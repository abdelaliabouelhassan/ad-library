    "description": "\"Grandma, is he really that powerful?\"\n\nIn the bustling commercial street, the girl turned on her phone, and the wallpaper just happened to be a young man in plain clothes.\n\nWhy would there still be people wearing cotton clothes at this day and age? The girl pouted her thin lips and secretly thought to herself that when she saw him the next day, the first thing she would do was to make him change his clothes.\n\nA seventy-year-old silver-haired old lady who was next to her stopped and smiled.\n\n\"Silly girl, you don't like him?\" The old woman turned around.\n\nThe girl bit her thin lips with her pearly white teeth, and her clear eyes were filled with unwillingness.\n\nThe conversation started quietly just like that.\n\nShe furrowed her brows and said, \"Grandma, look at him. He's the same age as me, yet he's dressed like a little old man. His white cotton clothes are so ugly!\"\n\n\"Impudent!\" The old woman rapped the ground with her dragon staff.\n\nWith a thump, the stone slab beneath her feet shattered into pieces.\n\nThe street vendors were so scared that they peed their pants.\n\nThe girl was very stubborn and refused to change her point of view.\n\n\"Heather, I want you to remember this. He may be dressed plainly, but there are things you can't tell from how one dresses. Do you know why 800,000 soldiers were gathered at the border three years ago?!\" The old woman said solemnly.\n\n\"I don't. I think it was a border conflict. Didn't they retreat in the end?\"\n\nThe girl was serious as she tried to recall what happened.\n\nThe old woman used her calmest tone possible, but what came out of her mouth made people's blood boil.\n\n\"Of course, they had to retreat,\" the old woman said slowly. \"With him at the border, how would the enemies outside dare not retreat? \n\n\"A simple cotton cloth intimidated 800,000 elites! \n\n\"He is Braydon Neal!\"\n\nThe old woman slowly revealed a secret.\n\n\"How is that possible?\" The girl cried out. \"He scared off 800,000 enemies with just a piece of clothing. What is he? A deity?\"\n\n\"If there's someone in this world who can become a deity, it can only be him!\"\n\nThe old woman was a little tired, so she slowly disappeared from the bustling street with the girl.\n\nIf there was anyone in the world who could become a deity, it would be the legend of the northern region, Braydon Neal.\n\nHe was a deity-like man in plain clothes!\n\nA single comment was enough to describe his legend.\n\nThe most terrifying cotton cloth in the world!\n\n...\n\nThe old woman and the young woman disappeared from the bustling streets of Preston city.\n\nIn the vast ocean thousands of miles away, a huge passenger ship was sailing east.\n\nA young man in plain clothes was sitting on the seat near the door of the passenger ship. His eyes were as bright as the stars, and his handsome lips seemed to always have a humble smile.\n\nOn the inner lane of the seats, there was a thin and weak old man who appeared to be feeling rather uneasy. His face, which had been burned by a fierce fire, was quite ferocious and terrifying.\n\nHis lips were dry and cracked, and he was sweating.\n\nThe young man in plain clothes was Braydon Neal. He said gently, \"Sir, are you thirsty?\"\n\n\"A little!\" The emaciated old man bitterly admitted.\n\nBraydon handed him a cup of tea, not bothering the hostess.\n\nHowever, the old man's drinking capacity was obviously higher than ordinary people. This was not thirst but an illness!\n\nIt was similar to traumatic sequelae!\n\nBraydon waited for the old man to finish his water before asking, \"Sir, were your injuries caused by a huge fire?\"\n\n\"I used to be a firefighter. Five years ago, there was a fire in Preston. I rushed in with my squadron to put out the fire. I'm a tough person, and I didn't die even though I was severely burned.\"\n\nThe old man had a self-deprecating smile on his lips.\n\nThe fire was so terrifying that the waves of fire rose tens of meters high and swallowed the entire squad. It had even burned him to such a terrifying state.\n\nHow cruel it was for a person to live beyond recognition!\n\nAs the listener, Braydon listened to the old man's story about the raging fire. He then noticed that his cup was empty, so he got up and went to buy some mineral water.\n\nWhen Braydon turned around, he saw that the seat was empty.\n\nThe old man was standing in front of the public water heater. Both his hands were thin, and he only had six fingers. The cruise had been sailing for the whole day, and he had not had a single drop of water. He was already slightly hungry.\n\nBehind the old man stood a burly man in a black suit. He frowned and urged, \"Old man, what are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm done now.\"\n\nThe old man's body was weak. Under the urging of the man, he turned off the tap nervously and turned to leave.\n\nHowever, the burly man's patience had long run out. He pushed the old man away and hurriedly took out a crystal cup to get some hot water.\n\nThe old man's body swayed, and an instant cup noodle fell out of his hand, spilling the soup all over the ground.\n\nAt the front of the corridor sat a young man with fair skin. There were instant noodles on the ground under his feet. His eyes turned dark, and he was filled with anger as he sneered, \"You old dog, are you f--king looking for death?\"\n\nSmack!\n\nThe fair-skinned young man suddenly stood up and slapped the old man on the face.\n\nThe old man staggered a few steps backward and almost fell to the ground.\n\nThe man in the suit turned around, his face pale. \"Young master Larson, are you alright?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" The fair-skinned youth, Ian Larson, shot him a glance.\n\nThe man in the suit was a bodyguard. He trembled and turned around to punch and kick the old man while scolding angrily, \"You blind old thing. Do you know who you've offended?\"\n\nHe was the second young master of the Larson family, one of the seven greatest families in Preston!\n\nIn Preston, the Larson family was deeply rooted. In recent years, they had been doing well and were becoming more and more prosperous. They had a vague chance of becoming the head of the seven great families.\n\nIn Preston, there was no one he, Ian Larson, could not afford to offend!\n\nThe passengers around him looked at him with fear in their eyes, and no one came forward to stop him.\n\nNot many families in Preston could afford to offend the Larson family.\n\nBut at this moment, someone stood forward.\n\nUnder everyone's gazes.\n\nBraydon's thin lips moved slightly as he said, \"If you touch him one more time, I'll kill your entire family!\"\n\nWhoosh!\n\nThere was pin-drop silence in the entire place.\n\nWho was this person?\n\nHe even dared to provoke the Larson family. In Preston, even the other great families would not dare to say things like wiping out the entire Larson family.\n\nThe bodyguard froze, and his fist stopped in mid-air.\n\n\"Who the f--k are you? Continue beating him up!\" Ian laughed in anger.\n\nChapter 2: The Return of the Northern King\nThe bodyguard raised his fist, and it was about to hit its mark.\n\nBraydon Neal's eyes were calm. He raised his fair left hand and lowered it in an instant.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe bodyguard's 1.9-meter-tall body was sent flying across the entire corridor, and it was unknown whether he was dead or alive.\n\nIan Larson's eyes were filled with horror. This terrifying martial strength was simply too frightening!\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asked fearfully.\n\nBraydon did not even glance at him. He bent down and helped the old man up.\n\nWho was Braydon Neal?\n\nThe Northern territory was three million square kilometers in land; there was no one who did not know who Braydon Neal was!\n\nHe was the Northern King of the northern territory!\n\nThere was once someone who had the word 'King' before his name.\n\nHis full name was King Braydon Neal!\n\nAt that time, Braydon was already famous in the capital, and it was during those days when he was young and frivolous. However, from then on, Braydon put on plain clothes and refused to be crowned king.\n\n\"Do you know who he is?\" Braydon asked softly.\n\n\"Who is he? This old thing? Ha!\" Ian's disdainful expression did not change.\n\n\"He may be covered in scars, but it signifies glory. He's a man of great merit, but he's been humiliated by you today. This is what it means when villains hold all the power!\" Braydon said softly.\n\n\"Great merit? This old thing was a soldier and made some kind of contribution?\" Ian was stubborn through and through.\n\nHe probably really thought that the Larson family could do whatever they wanted.\n\nThe so-called Larson family was just a clown in Braydon's eyes!\n\nIan should be aware that if the Northern King were angered, blood would flow for thousands of miles!\n\nA piece of cloth could scare off 800,000 enemies from outside the border. That was when Braydon was young, guarding the north alone. He killed 720,000 enemies with one knife, and the bones of his enemies formed mountains.\n\nSince then, King Braydon's fierce reputation had been established!\n\nAs long as he was still alive, no one would dare to invade the borders of the country!\n\nBraydon said softly, \"A firefighter is still a soldier. In the raging fire, he protected people with his life. Now, he has exchanged it for humiliation from you. You should be killed!\"\n\nAlong with the last half of Braydon's words, a shocking murderous aura shot up to the skies. Seagulls folded their wings, white fish jumped into the water, and animals were instinctively afraid!\n\n\"No one can touch me in Preston city. I'm a member of the Larson family. You can't afford to offend me!\" Ian said fiercely.\n\nBang!\n\nBraydon had intended to kill him, but after hearing this, he spared his life.\n\nAfter a single slap, Ian was sent flying in the air, and he lay crumpled on the ground like a dead dog.\n\n\"The Larson family is very powerful?\"\n\nBraydon's eyes were cold, and the temperature of the entire cabin seemed to have dropped by 30%.\n\nThe passengers around them nodded instinctively. The Larson family was truly powerful in Preston!\n\nHitting Ian Larson was equivalent to getting into big trouble!\n\n\"When we get to Preston, I'll show you what real power is!\" Braydon's thin lips moved slightly.\n\nIan said that no one in Preston city could touch him?\n\nSuch arrogance!\n\nBraydon did not mind waiting until he had arrived in Preston to show Ian what true power was!\n\nThe old man was helped up, tears streaming down his face like a child who had been wronged. \"It's been so many years. I didn't think that anyone would still remember us. Child, thank you!\"\n\nBraydon smiled indifferently and brought him back to his seat to rest, leaving Ian to yell and curse at him.\n\n\"When the passenger ship docks, I'll kill you! \n\n\"Offending me is the same as offending the Larson family. The moment you get off the ship, it will be the day you die! \n\n\"Enjoy the last ten minutes of your life!\"\n\n...\n\nIan's eyes were filled with hatred; he hated Braydon to the core.\n\nNo one on the passenger ship dared to meddle in their business.\n\nAs the passenger ship's horn sounded, it slowed down and slowly approached the dock.\n\nIn the vast open space of the dock, an old butler, along with fifty black-clothed bodyguards, was waiting there with a solemn expression on his face. He had already received a call from his second young master.\n\nThe dignified second young master of the Larson family was actually beaten up to such an extent!\n\nThey were in Preston city. No matter who it was, that person was obviously courting death.\n\nEven if he was a member of the seven great families, he would be crippled if not killed.\n\nThe old butler had already made up his mind.\n\nAfter the ship had docked, Ian was limping as he disembarked. The old butler hurried forward.\n\n\"Second young master!\"\n\nThe fifty strong bodyguards lowered their heads and shouted in unison.\n\nThe other passengers who got off the ship lowered their heads and left in a hurry.\n\nAfter the passengers had left, Braydon looked at his homeland and muttered, \"My hometown is no longer the same; how unfortunate. I didn't expect that I would have this feeling!\"\n\nIan sneered, thinking that Braydon was too scared to get off the ship.\n\nHe growled, \"Didn't you want me to see what true power is in Preston? Why are you still stuck on board, you coward?! \n\n\"In Preston, the Larson family is the symbol of power!\"\n\n\"Seize him!\" The old butler said while gesturing at him.\n\nDozens of security guards were about to make a move!\n\nThe autumn wind was blowing in the spacious dock, rolling up the yellow apricot leaves. It seemed that the place had been cleared long ago.\n\nThere were very few people today!\n\nIn the southeast, a group of young men in black clothes appeared.\n\nThere were more than a thousand people, all dressed in black with black scarves on their faces. They had long black swords at their waists which were three feet, three inches, and three decimeters long. There was a red symbol on their chest which looked a little like the Northern King's sword!\n\nThese young men in black numbered up to more than a thousand had appeared at the dock and were slowly approaching the ship.\n\nTheir footsteps were uniformed, and strong aura and gallant determination exuded from their presence. \n\nIn the next moment.\n\nThe thousands of people unsheathed their swords, and their killing intent soared to the sky.\n\nEveryone's expression was cold, and their tiger-like eyes were filled with determination, revealing a fanatical belief!\n\nAlthough the person on the cruise was merely wearing plain cotton clothes, he was their one common faith!\n\nHe had left the capital at the age of seven and had not returned for thirteen years!\n\nAnd today was the day of his coronation!\n\nThe more than a thousand people came to the passenger ship, knelt down on one knee, and plunged their swords into the ground to welcome the passenger ship with such grand gesture.\n\n\"The Northern Hansworth main team welcomes the return of the commander!\" The more than a thousand people shouted in unison.\n\nThe sound waves rolled and reverberated through the sky.\n\nThis was the power that Braydon was talking about!\n\nThis scene caused Ian's eyes to be filled with horror. It was hard to imagine.\n\nThe old butler's face was deathly pale. His life experience told him that he had provoked a terrifying person today!\n\nThis important figure was not someone the Larson family could provoke.\n\nBraydon slowly disembarked the passenger ship and smiled. \"I'm a commoner. I don't have an official rank or title. Just call me by my name!\"\n\n\"We dare not act as such. Rules cannot be broken. No one in the world would ever dare address the commander as a commoner!\"\n\nAmong the one thousand people, the young man in the lead had a buzzcut and looked strong and aggressive.\n\nBraydon looked at him and chuckled. \"Little Carl Mason, I didn't expect you to come and pick me up today. I'm afraid you've crossed the border just to do so!\"\n\nThe Northern Hansworth main team had a lot of responsibilities. They were in charge of all the tricky matters in the 830,000 square kilometers area.\n\nBut this was Central Hansworth!\n\nPreston city was located in Central Hansworth. Many people used to call this place the resplendent central plains!\n\n\"So be it. Did the commander run into any trouble upon returning?\"\n\nCarl glanced at Ian and the others.\n\n\"He said that no one in Preston city can touch him!\"\n\nBraydon flicked his fingers and laughed.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nThe thousand people stood up and pointed their blades at Ian. He was so scared that he was about to cry.\n\nIan had said that no one in Preston city could touch him!\n\nBut today, there were over a thousand people here. Not to mention touching him, they could even exterminate the three families of the Larson family with a snap of their fingers.\n\nThe old butler was sweating profusely as he apologized incessantly, \"Sir, this might be a misunderstanding!\"\n\n\"Then, let this misunderstanding continue!\" Carl then seized everyone present.\n\nChapter 3: Hansworth Warblade\nBraydon Neal turned around and left, leaving behind a sentence, \"Ian Larson may have done wrong, but he's innocent!\"\n\nWith just a few words, the more than a thousand people sheathed their swords and followed Braydon.\n\n\"Commander, come back to Northern Hansworth with us!\" Carl Mason quickly followed behind him.\n\nBraydon did not respond. Since he had chosen to return to Preston, he naturally had things to do.\n\nCarl hesitated before saying, \"Your return this time is only for the crowning ceremony. After the ceremony, as long as you return to Northern Hansworth, we can guarantee that no one will hurt you!\"\n\n\"Hurt me?\" Braydon stopped, a faint smile on his lips.\n\nCarl smiled bitterly as if he had just realized something.\n\nHowever, there were some things that Braydon did not need the help of outsiders.\n\n\"I'm back at the capital to kill three people!\" Braydon said indifferently.\n\nCarl was stunned. He wanted to say that he would do these things for Braydon.\n\nThe special authority of the Northern Hansworth main team was shockingly tremendous!\n\nNow that Braydon refused to say anything, Carl naturally did not dare to ask further.\n\nThe group left the dock. There were as many as twenty black cars parked outside, which corresponded to Braydon's age. Each car was worth more than a million dollars.\n\nThere was a silver-haired old woman with a dragon-headed walking stick standing there, and a beautiful girl was standing beside her. Her light blue sportswear outlined her perfect figure, and her long legs were particularly eye-catching.\n\nThe girl was Heather Sage, Preston's most talented woman. She was also the one who had said that Braydon looked ugly in plain clothes last night.\n\n\"Grandma, we've been waiting for half an hour!\" She pouted in dissatisfaction.\n\nHeather was a little dissatisfied. She felt that her fianc√©, whom she had never met before, was much too arrogant to make her and her grandmother wait for so long.\n\nOld lady Sage said calmly, \"Just wait. If you don't see him today and you dare to leave, I'll break your legs!\"\n\n\"Is he that important?\" Heather was secretly angry.\n\nAt the spacious exit of the dock, Braydon, who was dressed in plain clothes, had just appeared.\n\n\"He's here!\" Old lady Sage's fingers trembled.\n\n\"It's really him!\"\n\nHeather saw him as well, and she also saw a thousand young men in Black clothes and black scarves behind Braydon.\n\nA thousand people escorting him; what a grand display!\n\nWho was he?\n\nHeather's eyes were filled with curiosity.\n\nThe old and the young lady had yet to step forward when something unexpected happened.\n\nFrom the East, an indomitable figure appeared. His square face was full of hair, and after it had been trimmed, it looked very comfortable.\n\nHis tiger-like eyes were filled with anger, and every step he took caused the ground to tremble. As he released his aura, the people on the roadside were afraid to watch the show.\n\n\"Carl Mason, you've crossed the line!\"\n\nThe tiger-eyed man was the commander of Central Hansworth, Zayn Ziegler.\n\nThere were seventy-two cities in the three provinces of Central Hansworth, and there were eighty-one special operations teams all under the jurisdiction of the Central Hansworth main team!\n\nThere was one team in each city. The special operations team's responsibilities were extensive. They did not care about the ordinary trifles and usually dealt with the more difficult matters.\n\nWhenever there were peculiar incidents, it was usually the special operations team that directly intervened.\n\nCarl glanced at him. \"What can you do if I cross the line? Chop me into pieces?\"\n\n\"Why you!\"\n\nZayn Ziegler almost exploded in anger. This man was as famous as him, but he did not expect him to be so shameless today.\n\nWas he planning to lose face?\n\nZayn Ziegler was angry. \"The five great commanders in the country each has their own duties. They are strictly prohibited from crossing the border. Those who violate the rules will be reported and punished. Are you so determined to be so disgraceful and annoy me like this?\"\n\nCarl rolled his eyes and did not bother to answer.\n\nNot far away, old lady Sage was holding a dragon-headed walking stick, her hands trembling slightly.\n\n\"Carl Mason, the Tiger of Northern Hansworth, and Zayn Ziegler, the Warblade of Central Plains,\" she said in a low voice. \"They're here!\"\n\n\"Grandma, when Grandpa was alive, didn't he say that he was a person who stood at the peak of Mount Tanish?\"\n\nHeather stuck out her tongue and did not dare to say anything else.\n\nOld lady Sage pursed her thin lips. She knew how terrifying these two big shots were. She also knew where the young men wearing black scarves behind them belonged to!\n\nThese two big shots did not even need to acknowledge the so-called seven great families of Preston. With just a word, they could make the seven great families disappear overnight.\n\nAt that time, no one would speak up for the seven great families, and no one would even dare to ask.\n\nBraydon was already looking at old lady Sage, and a humble smile appeared on his lips. His thin lips moved slightly, \"We haven't seen each other for a few years. Little central plains, who do you want to report to the higher-ups and punish?\"\n\nBraydon's back was facing Zayn and the others when he spoke calmly.\n\nZayn's eyelids twitched, and his eyes were filled with horror and disbelief as he looked at the back of the plain-clothed man.\n\nHis face turned red, and he cried out, \"Co... Cotton cloth?!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nBraydon turned around slowly with a faint smile on his face.\n\nThe moment his face appeared, Zayn Ziegler, who was famous in the three provinces of the central plains, knelt down on one knee and said, \"Central Hansworth's commander, Zayn Ziegler, welcomes the return of the Northern King!\"\n\nBraydon flicked his fingers and smiled, signaling for him to get up and talk.\n\nZayn scratched his head. \"A few days ago, there was a rumor saying that you were coming back. I didn't believe it. I didn't expect you to really come back!\"\n\n\"You and I are both commanders. There's no need to be so humble!\" Braydon walked forward.\n\nZayn's face turned pale.\n\nThe strongest man in the three provinces of the central plains was as pale as a sheet today. He thought that Braydon was dissatisfied with him today.\n\nZayn pulled out his sword and knelt on one knee. He held the black sword high above his head with both hands.\n\nHis tiger-like eyes seemed to be burning with flames as he said in a low voice, \"The five great commanders of Hansworth are all under the command of the Northern King. If they die, they will be the war spirit of the North, forever guarding the beautiful mountains and rivers of Hansworth, fending off foreign enemies, and guarding the borders!\"\n\nThe commander of Northern Hansworth was supposed to be Carl. Braydon's sudden return indicated that he could not be without any recognition and title. Otherwise, no one amongst the one million black-armored elites in the North would agree to it!\n\nTherefore, Carl was as happy as a child when Braydon became the commander of Northern Hansworth.\n\nBraydon ignored him and walked toward old lady Sage. What he said next shocked everyone.\n\n\"Grandma!\" Braydon's lips moved.\n\nüòçClick to read onüëâüëâ<The King Of Passive Skills> in APP",

    "description": "‚ÄúLet's get a divorce!‚Äù Xie Tiansheng said casually as he ground out the cigarette on the ashtray.\n\nHe crossed his legs and rested lazily on the sofa. He did not even bother to look at his wife, Xia Muqing whose face has ashened like all the blood has been drained from her face with her lips pursed tightly.\n\nWith nothing on his sexy and muscular body but a simple white towel wrapped around his lower body, a disgusting stench permeated and lingered around the air inside the room......\n\nThat stench was coming from the semen that had leaked onto the sheets of the messy bed.\n\nHowever, the woman that was on the receiving end of said semen was not Xia Muqing!\n\nShe did not know who was the other woman that was on the bed. But Xia Muqing's eyes were met with such a revolting scene as she entered Xie Tiansheng's office to bring him some snacks.\n\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Xia Muqing questioned Xie Tiansheng with a trembling voice.\n\nXie Tiansheng slowly lifted his gaze and met with Xia Muqing's face at long last. That man's eyes were pensive as he spoke in a dissatisfied tone. ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter who she is. What matters the most is that we are getting a divorce!‚Äù\n\nMuqing's grip tightened around the reusable bag in her hand and was stunned for a moment.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes. ‚ÄúXie Tiansheng, what is marriage to you? Who am I to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, stop embarrassing yourself, you should know better that you're nothing to me!!! I wouldn't have married you if not for the sake of the Xie family!‚Äù\n\nSo, the only reason he married me was because he wanted to utilize my family's influence to assist his own family? Is that why he's reluctant to caress my body even after 2 years of marriage?! That's why he wanted our marriage to be held privately without being known to the public.\n\nMuqing's hands were shaking as she could not contain her tears from falling continuously......\n\n‚ÄúAlright! Is that what you wanted? You wanted a divorce, Xie Tiansheng? I will grant you your wish......‚Äù Xia Muqing forced herself to speak with a steely voice, but her voice came out trembling.\n\nXie Tiansheng was astounded by her alacrity. He curled his sexy lips the next second and said, ‚ÄúVery well! I'll see you tomorrow at 9 o'clock in the morning in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI'll see you then!‚Äù Xia Muqing's fists tightened.\n\nShe turned around and stepped out of the office immediately. There was absolutely not a chance that she could stand being inside that room with the heavy and unbearable atmosphere, if she had stayed any longer, the pressure inside the room would surely suffocate her!\n\nHowever, tears started streaming down her cheeks like a broken dam as soon as she slammed the door shut.\n\nXia Muqing curled her body inside the cramp space of the elevator and like an abandoned child, she cried hysterically in anguish.\n\n‚ÄúDing-‚Äù Her ringtone reverberated inside the elevator as the relentless sound stung her ears.\n\nShe did not want to answer the call, but the other person was determined to dial her number until Xia Muqing answered the call. Finally, she picked up her phone as she could no longer bear with the annoying ringtone.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, where are you?‚Äù It was her manager as well as her best friend, Jin Xiaolu that called her.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu......‚Äù Muqing held her phone tightly and choked out her words like a pitiful child. ‚ÄúXiaolu, Tiansheng is dumping me. He's going to ditch me for real this time.... (sound of whimpering)‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu was silent for a few seconds as she listened to Muqing's sobs.\n\n‚ÄúThat heartless man!‚Äù An angry curse was heard through the speaker.\n\n‚ÄúStop crying, my baby girl. I've told you that the b wasn't even a real man! You should've parted ways with him in the past. Listen to me, I've just received a phone call from my company. They informed me that we'll be working outstation in Japan for the upcoming month! We're boarding the international flight at 7 o'clock in the morning tomorrow.‚Äù Jin Xiaolu had always held great passion for her occupation.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu, I've agreed to meet with him at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing wanted to reject Xiaolu's arrangements to work outstation in Japan. She knew that she would not be able to focus on her work under such conditions.\n\nJin Xiaolu kept quiet for a long time before she spoke again. ‚ÄúMuqing, I hope that you'll reconsider this matter thoroughly before you make a sound decision. I know that you've always wanted to become Xie Tiansheng's wife in the last 2 years, but that man has rejected you now. You should start thinking for yourself. This trip to Japan would be a great steppingstone for your career advancement. Also, you can sign the divorce paper at any time. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, am I right? Mull this over then only make up your mind!‚Äù\n\nAt 10 o'clock in the night, Muqing returned to the empty and deserted home as usual.\n\nHer husband did not come home after all.\n\nShe quickly filled the fridge with all kinds of staple food, fruits and drinks that Xie Tiansheng consumed on a daily basis.\n\nAfter she was done prepping in the kitchen, she went upstairs into that man's room.\n\nShe wanted to prepare a month's worth of that man's outfit for him because she had to leave the country to Japan for outstation work. Xia Muqing did not want her husband to be worried about his daily lives when she's not around the home to serve him.\n\nOnce she was done, Muqing put on a contented smile.\n\nXie Tiansheng would not abandon an obedient and caring wife like me, right? So, he must've proposed that divorce out of anger, am I right? I cannot perceive that proposition as his true intention! Xia Muqing comforted herself in her own mind.\n\nXia Muqing dialed her husband's number at that thought. No one picked up the call initially, but the call connected after some time. The sound of a couple making love and moaning persistently was heard through the speaker.\n\nA woman was twisting her alluring figure relentlessly on a man's body as she complained. ‚ÄúTiansheng, your ringtone is killing the mood!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGo and fetch my phone over. Switch off that damn phone!‚Äù said Xie Tiansheng as he slapped the woman's round buttocks.\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù The woman got up from his body and tiptoed towards the sofa to pick up the phone. She spoke with a coquettish smile. ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do? It's a call from your wife.‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng's face darkened. He corrected the woman. ‚ÄúShe's my ex-wife now!‚Äù\n\nThe woman smiled. ‚ÄúShould I hang up the call then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo need for that. Just answer the call!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou want me to answer the call?‚Äù The woman replied, obviously aghast at his suggestion.\n\n‚ÄúWhat's the matter? Are you afraid that she'll recognize your voice?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng smiled impishly at the woman.\n\nBut the woman smiled skittishly and said, ‚ÄúWell, she's going to know about us anyway!‚Äù\n\nShe swiped the screen and received the call as she strode towards that man with her pair of slender and fair-skinned legs.\n\n‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Xia Muqing's gentle voice can be heard through the speaker. At the same time, the woman had positioned herself brazenly on Xie Tiansheng's muscular hips and moaned flirtatiously.\n\n‚ÄúAh...‚Äù The sexual moans penetrated Xia Muqing's auditory sense. Her pale face flushed red at that instant.\n\n‚ÄúI. I'm looking for Xie Tiansheng...‚Äù Muqing's voice was trembling, and her hand that was holding the phone was trembling violently.\n\n‚ÄúHe's very busy right now! You can talk to me instead. I'm his fianc√©e....‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAhh.... Tiansheng, slow down for a bit... slow down... ahhhh....‚Äù The woman's voice coupled with a man's labored breathing washed over Xia Muqing as she listened to the sound originating from the other end of the phone.\n\nXia Muqing felt a heart-wrenching pain as if someone was tearing her heart into pieces.\n\nFianc√©e? He's already found a backup wife for himself before we even finalize our divorce?\n\nMuqing took a deep breath and suppressed her urge to break down in tears. ‚ÄúPlease tell Xie Tiansheng that I won't be able to make it to the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing strained herself to finish that sentence. She hung up the phone before she received any response from the other end of the call.\n\nTears fell from her cheeks, and her fragile body slumped onto the cold hard floor in despair. She covered her face with her hands and broke down in tears the next second.\n\nXie Tiansheng, what did I do to wrong you for you to treat me like this! I've poured all my sincerity to love you and what did I receive in return? Did you even cherish my affection towards you for just a single moment throughout our marriage?!\n\nAt 2 o'clock in the midnight, Muqing froze for a split second as she sat on the sofa in a daze when the sound of someone unlocking the door was heard.\n\nShe then forced herself to put on a smile and without even putting on her shoes, she walked barefooted and welcomed the man that had entered the door.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, you're back!‚Äù A hint of obedience and joy filled her gleaming eyes.\n\nMuqing thought that her husband would never return home again. She thought that Xie Tiansheng would not want to even see her again on their last night as a married couple. But he came home after all.\n\nXie Tiansheng was startled by Xia Muqing's passionate greetings. He was stunned for a second but quickly put on a frown. Then he entered the house and disregarded the woman's enthusiasm. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, we must sign the divorce paper tomorrow!‚Äù\n\nThe smile on Xia Muqing's face stiffened. Then she spoke with a diminished voice. ‚ÄúI'm not free tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng turned around and fixed his cold stare on the woman. Then he scoffed, ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I knew! You're not willing to cut ties with me!‚Äù\n\nMuqing took a deep breath to suppress her tears and forced her pretty lips into a faint smile. ‚ÄúTiansheng, let's not talk about this for now, please?‚Äù\n\nDeep down in her heart, Muqing had to admit that she was not willing to let go of their relationship, just yet.\n\nXie Tiansheng looked at her with a face filled with disgust. He moved closer to Xia Muqing in just a few steps.\n\nWith his long fingers, he clasped Muqing tightly on her chin, causing Muqing to frown slightly due to the pain from the unrestrained force that he had exerted on her delicate face.\n\nWith a tone full of mockery, Xie Tiansheng spoke. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, did you not listen to that phone call earlier? Are you really going to ignore everything that you've heard? You're such an undignified woman for throwing away the last hint of self-respect towards yourself. You're such a pitiful person!‚Äù\n\nHis cruel words stabbed mercilessly through her heart like a sharp knife.\n\nMuqing's shoulder shuddered due to the physical and emotional pain that was inflicted upon her.\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, are you still hoping that I, Xie Tiansheng will still love you? Let me tell you this again, I have never loved you and I never will! All I feel is disgust towards you!‚Äù\n\nTears fell from the corner of her eyes as Muqing could no longer suppress her grievances.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng did not even look at her but only turned around and headed upstairs on his own.\n\nDriven by insanity, Xia Muqing emptied the content of the fridge and tossed all the items into the rubbish bin in the middle of the night at 2am.\n\nOne by one, she tossed them all into the bin disdainfully without feeling any reluctance, just like how Xia Tiansheng had ditched her sincerity and trampled all over her affection towards him......\n\nAt 5 o'clock in the early morning, Xia Muqing had left the house with her luggage while Xie Tiansheng was still sound asleep.\n\nJin Xiaolu and her assistant had been waiting for Xia Muqing in front of her house in their exclusive MPV.\n\nThe moment Jin Xiaolu saw the depressive look and ashen face of Xia Muqing, she was stunned. But quickly, she regained back her senses and hurried over to help carry her luggage.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, cheer up! Think of this 1-month trip to Japan as our holiday!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù Muqing responded with an obscured smile.\n\nAt 7 o'clock sharp in the morning, the plane was ready to take off.\n\nJin Xiaolu wanted to talk about their 1-month business trip itinerary with Muqing, but she refrained herself from doing so after noticing Muqing's dampened mood.\n\nHence, Jin Xiaolu set aside the documents and sighed to herself before she comforted Xia Muqing. ‚ÄúTo be honest, Muqing, I'm really happy for you when you said that you're finally going to divorce that b, Xie Tiansheng!‚Äù\n\nHer words instantly touched Muqing's stone-cold heart, but she stuck her face onto the window without giving Jin Xiaolu any reply.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, you could've reached the same height in your career as your sister, Zhi, if not for this shallow marriage that had restricted your progress. You wouldn't have remained a mediocre actress up until this point if not for that Xie Tiansheng.‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu expressed her regrets through her words.\n\nIt was true, from Jin Xiaolu's point of view, Xia Muqing was a talented actress with limitless potential. She could have outperformed her sister, but Xia Muqing had rejected multiple offers for her to be promoted because of her husband, Xie Tiansheng as he was not fond of his wife exposing herself in public at all times! There was even a time when Xia Muqing had planned to retire from the entertainment field on an impulse due to Xie Tiansheng. But luckily enough, Jin Xiaolu was there to prevent her from making that decision, since being an actress was Muqing's lifelong dream after all.\n\n‚ÄúI'm sorry....‚Äù Muqing turned to face Jin Xiaolu and apologized to her. ‚ÄúYou could've become the manager of an actress that is far better than me, but you've never given up on me. For that, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, Xiaolu....‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu smiled. ‚ÄúThat's because I can foresee your value in the future! Muqing, have faith in me! Trust me when I say that you are going to reach the peak in the entertainment field and shine brighter than any other actress! But for that to happen, you first need to stop lowering your standards for that b, Xie Tiansheng! He's not someone that's worthy of your sacrifices.‚Äù\n\nRight beside her, Xie Muqing smiled faintly and said, ‚ÄúI'll try my best......‚Äù\n\nNot long after that, Muqing did achieve the highest peak in the entertainment field and shone brighter than any other actresses as Jin Xiaolu predicted. She managed to look down on Xie Tiansheng and his mistress from the pedestal built by her success. But of course, that was a story for another time.\n\nOn her fifth day in Japan, Muqing's private cell phone never rang. Xie Tiansheng had never called her, not even once.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng's existence was like a bacterium, infecting and munching down on her broken heart, and as the time went by, her wound worsened, leaving Muqing only with a pain that may overwhelm her soon.\n\nThat night, after a magazine photoshoot, Muqing excused herself from Xiaolu's monitoring by stating that she wanted some time alone to stroll around.\n\nMuqing walked around the streets of Japan aimlessly. After a while, she stopped abruptly in front of a lively night club.\n\nXia Muqing fell into a trance as she stared at the heated atmosphere inside the club through the glass window and entered the night club unwittingly.\n\nPerhaps I should get drunk for once. I'll be able to forget about all the painful memories when I'm drunk. Then I would not suffer any longer from the anguish.\n\nMuqing did not know how much alcohol she drank, but that was the first time she had downed so much at once. She gazed drowsily at the happenings inside the chaotic night club; some cute Japanese boys would come and strike up a conversation occasionally, but most of them were hosts that worked at the club.\n\nHowever, Muqing did not bother herself with the boys that wanted to chat with her. She took out her phone and dialed Xie Tiansheng's number daringly under the influence of alcohol.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, what are you doing?‚Äù She sobbed and asked the man through the phone.\n\nWith a cold and indifferent attitude, Xie Tiansheng said ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I'm very busy right now, talk to my assistant if you have anything to say to me!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you busy in the middle of the night......‚Äù Muqing started to throw a tantrum as the alcohol disrupted her normal thought process. ‚ÄúYou're always telling me to talk to your assistant!! Xie Tiansheng, I married you, not your assistant!‚Äù sobbed Muqing.\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, are you drunk right now?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng sounded serious all of the sudden.\n\nMuqing sensed the change in his tone and felt a leap of joy in her heart.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, I know that you're still worried about me......‚Äù Muqing smiled contentedly.\n\n‚ÄúWorried?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng sneered. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I just wanted to remind you that you should be looking for someone else if you wanted to act crazy after you're drunk! I'm very busy, so don't ever bother me again! I'm going to sleep now!‚Äù\n\n.........................................\nGo to Flipread to search for the title \"Girl, Life Turns Around\"\nRead more exciting content immediately ;)",

    "description": "‚ÄúLet's get a divorce!‚Äù Xie Tiansheng said casually as he ground out the cigarette on the ashtray.\n\nHe crossed his legs and rested lazily on the sofa. He did not even bother to look at his wife, Xia Muqing whose face has ashened like all the blood has been drained from her face with her lips pursed tightly.\n\nWith nothing on his sexy and muscular body but a simple white towel wrapped around his lower body, a disgusting stench permeated and lingered around the air inside the room......\n\nThat stench was coming from the semen that had leaked onto the sheets of the messy bed.\n\nHowever, the woman that was on the receiving end of said semen was not Xia Muqing!\n\nShe did not know who was the other woman that was on the bed. But Xia Muqing's eyes were met with such a revolting scene as she entered Xie Tiansheng's office to bring him some snacks.\n\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Xia Muqing questioned Xie Tiansheng with a trembling voice.\n\nXie Tiansheng slowly lifted his gaze and met with Xia Muqing's face at long last. That man's eyes were pensive as he spoke in a dissatisfied tone. ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter who she is. What matters the most is that we are getting a divorce!‚Äù\n\nMuqing's grip tightened around the reusable bag in her hand and was stunned for a moment.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes. ‚ÄúXie Tiansheng, what is marriage to you? Who am I to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, stop embarrassing yourself, you should know better that you're nothing to me!!! I wouldn't have married you if not for the sake of the Xie family!‚Äù\n\nSo, the only reason he married me was because he wanted to utilize my family's influence to assist his own family? Is that why he's reluctant to caress my body even after 2 years of marriage?! That's why he wanted our marriage to be held privately without being known to the public.\n\nMuqing's hands were shaking as she could not contain her tears from falling continuously......\n\n‚ÄúAlright! Is that what you wanted? You wanted a divorce, Xie Tiansheng? I will grant you your wish......‚Äù Xia Muqing forced herself to speak with a steely voice, but her voice came out trembling.\n\nXie Tiansheng was astounded by her alacrity. He curled his sexy lips the next second and said, ‚ÄúVery well! I'll see you tomorrow at 9 o'clock in the morning in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI'll see you then!‚Äù Xia Muqing's fists tightened.\n\nShe turned around and stepped out of the office immediately. There was absolutely not a chance that she could stand being inside that room with the heavy and unbearable atmosphere, if she had stayed any longer, the pressure inside the room would surely suffocate her!\n\nHowever, tears started streaming down her cheeks like a broken dam as soon as she slammed the door shut.\n\nXia Muqing curled her body inside the cramp space of the elevator and like an abandoned child, she cried hysterically in anguish.\n\n‚ÄúDing-‚Äù Her ringtone reverberated inside the elevator as the relentless sound stung her ears.\n\nShe did not want to answer the call, but the other person was determined to dial her number until Xia Muqing answered the call. Finally, she picked up her phone as she could no longer bear with the annoying ringtone.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, where are you?‚Äù It was her manager as well as her best friend, Jin Xiaolu that called her.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu......‚Äù Muqing held her phone tightly and choked out her words like a pitiful child. ‚ÄúXiaolu, Tiansheng is dumping me. He's going to ditch me for real this time.... (sound of whimpering)‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu was silent for a few seconds as she listened to Muqing's sobs.\n\n‚ÄúThat heartless man!‚Äù An angry curse was heard through the speaker.\n\n‚ÄúStop crying, my baby girl. I've told you that the b wasn't even a real man! You should've parted ways with him in the past. Listen to me, I've just received a phone call from my company. They informed me that we'll be working outstation in Japan for the upcoming month! We're boarding the international flight at 7 o'clock in the morning tomorrow.‚Äù Jin Xiaolu had always held great passion for her occupation.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu, I've agreed to meet with him at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing wanted to reject Xiaolu's arrangements to work outstation in Japan. She knew that she would not be able to focus on her work under such conditions.\n\nJin Xiaolu kept quiet for a long time before she spoke again. ‚ÄúMuqing, I hope that you'll reconsider this matter thoroughly before you make a sound decision. I know that you've always wanted to become Xie Tiansheng's wife in the last 2 years, but that man has rejected you now. You should start thinking for yourself. This trip to Japan would be a great steppingstone for your career advancement. Also, you can sign the divorce paper at any time. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, am I right? Mull this over then only make up your mind!‚Äù\n\nAt 10 o'clock in the night, Muqing returned to the empty and deserted home as usual.\n\nHer husband did not come home after all.\n\nShe quickly filled the fridge with all kinds of staple food, fruits and drinks that Xie Tiansheng consumed on a daily basis.\n\nAfter she was done prepping in the kitchen, she went upstairs into that man's room.\n\nShe wanted to prepare a month's worth of that man's outfit for him because she had to leave the country to Japan for outstation work. Xia Muqing did not want her husband to be worried about his daily lives when she's not around the home to serve him.\n\nOnce she was done, Muqing put on a contented smile.\n\nXie Tiansheng would not abandon an obedient and caring wife like me, right? So, he must've proposed that divorce out of anger, am I right? I cannot perceive that proposition as his true intention! Xia Muqing comforted herself in her own mind.\n\nXia Muqing dialed her husband's number at that thought. No one picked up the call initially, but the call connected after some time. The sound of a couple making love and moaning persistently was heard through the speaker.\n\nA woman was twisting her alluring figure relentlessly on a man's body as she complained. ‚ÄúTiansheng, your ringtone is killing the mood!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGo and fetch my phone over. Switch off that damn phone!‚Äù said Xie Tiansheng as he slapped the woman's round buttocks.\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù The woman got up from his body and tiptoed towards the sofa to pick up the phone. She spoke with a coquettish smile. ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do? It's a call from your wife.‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng's face darkened. He corrected the woman. ‚ÄúShe's my ex-wife now!‚Äù\n\nThe woman smiled. ‚ÄúShould I hang up the call then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo need for that. Just answer the call!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou want me to answer the call?‚Äù The woman replied, obviously aghast at his suggestion.\n\n‚ÄúWhat's the matter? Are you afraid that she'll recognize your voice?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng smiled impishly at the woman.\n\nBut the woman smiled skittishly and said, ‚ÄúWell, she's going to know about us anyway!‚Äù\n\nShe swiped the screen and received the call as she strode towards that man with her pair of slender and fair-skinned legs.\n\n‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Xia Muqing's gentle voice can be heard through the speaker. At the same time, the woman had positioned herself brazenly on Xie Tiansheng's muscular hips and moaned flirtatiously.\n\n‚ÄúAh...‚Äù The sexual moans penetrated Xia Muqing's auditory sense. Her pale face flushed red at that instant.\n\n‚ÄúI. I'm looking for Xie Tiansheng...‚Äù Muqing's voice was trembling, and her hand that was holding the phone was trembling violently.\n\n‚ÄúHe's very busy right now! You can talk to me instead. I'm his fianc√©e....‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAhh.... Tiansheng, slow down for a bit... slow down... ahhhh....‚Äù The woman's voice coupled with a man's labored breathing washed over Xia Muqing as she listened to the sound originating from the other end of the phone.\n\nXia Muqing felt a heart-wrenching pain as if someone was tearing her heart into pieces.\n\nFianc√©e? He's already found a backup wife for himself before we even finalize our divorce?\n\nMuqing took a deep breath and suppressed her urge to break down in tears. ‚ÄúPlease tell Xie Tiansheng that I won't be able to make it to the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing strained herself to finish that sentence. She hung up the phone before she received any response from the other end of the call.\n\nTears fell from her cheeks, and her fragile body slumped onto the cold hard floor in despair. She covered her face with her hands and broke down in tears the next second.\n\nXie Tiansheng, what did I do to wrong you for you to treat me like this! I've poured all my sincerity to love you and what did I receive in return? Did you even cherish my affection towards you for just a single moment throughout our marriage?!\n\nAt 2 o'clock in the midnight, Muqing froze for a split second as she sat on the sofa in a daze when the sound of someone unlocking the door was heard.\n\nShe then forced herself to put on a smile and without even putting on her shoes, she walked barefooted and welcomed the man that had entered the door.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, you're back!‚Äù A hint of obedience and joy filled her gleaming eyes.\n\nMuqing thought that her husband would never return home again. She thought that Xie Tiansheng would not want to even see her again on their last night as a married couple. But he came home after all.\n\nXie Tiansheng was startled by Xia Muqing's passionate greetings. He was stunned for a second but quickly put on a frown. Then he entered the house and disregarded the woman's enthusiasm. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, we must sign the divorce paper tomorrow!‚Äù\n\nThe smile on Xia Muqing's face stiffened. Then she spoke with a diminished voice. ‚ÄúI'm not free tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng turned around and fixed his cold stare on the woman. Then he scoffed, ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I knew! You're not willing to cut ties with me!‚Äù\n\nMuqing took a deep breath to suppress her tears and forced her pretty lips into a faint smile. ‚ÄúTiansheng, let's not talk about this for now, please?‚Äù\n\nDeep down in her heart, Muqing had to admit that she was not willing to let go of their relationship, just yet.\n\nXie Tiansheng looked at her with a face filled with disgust. He moved closer to Xia Muqing in just a few steps.\n\nWith his long fingers, he clasped Muqing tightly on her chin, causing Muqing to frown slightly due to the pain from the unrestrained force that he had exerted on her delicate face.\n\nWith a tone full of mockery, Xie Tiansheng spoke. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, did you not listen to that phone call earlier? Are you really going to ignore everything that you've heard? You're such an undignified woman for throwing away the last hint of self-respect towards yourself. You're such a pitiful person!‚Äù\n\nHis cruel words stabbed mercilessly through her heart like a sharp knife.\n\nMuqing's shoulder shuddered due to the physical and emotional pain that was inflicted upon her.\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, are you still hoping that I, Xie Tiansheng will still love you? Let me tell you this again, I have never loved you and I never will! All I feel is disgust towards you!‚Äù\n\nTears fell from the corner of her eyes as Muqing could no longer suppress her grievances.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng did not even look at her but only turned around and headed upstairs on his own.\n\nDriven by insanity, Xia Muqing emptied the content of the fridge and tossed all the items into the rubbish bin in the middle of the night at 2am.\n\nOne by one, she tossed them all into the bin disdainfully without feeling any reluctance, just like how Xia Tiansheng had ditched her sincerity and trampled all over her affection towards him......\n\nAt 5 o'clock in the early morning, Xia Muqing had left the house with her luggage while Xie Tiansheng was still sound asleep.\n\nJin Xiaolu and her assistant had been waiting for Xia Muqing in front of her house in their exclusive MPV.\n\nThe moment Jin Xiaolu saw the depressive look and ashen face of Xia Muqing, she was stunned. But quickly, she regained back her senses and hurried over to help carry her luggage.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, cheer up! Think of this 1-month trip to Japan as our holiday!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù Muqing responded with an obscured smile.\n\nAt 7 o'clock sharp in the morning, the plane was ready to take off.\n\nJin Xiaolu wanted to talk about their 1-month business trip itinerary with Muqing, but she refrained herself from doing so after noticing Muqing's dampened mood.\n\nHence, Jin Xiaolu set aside the documents and sighed to herself before she comforted Xia Muqing. ‚ÄúTo be honest, Muqing, I'm really happy for you when you said that you're finally going to divorce that b, Xie Tiansheng!‚Äù\n\nHer words instantly touched Muqing's stone-cold heart, but she stuck her face onto the window without giving Jin Xiaolu any reply.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, you could've reached the same height in your career as your sister, Zhi, if not for this shallow marriage that had restricted your progress. You wouldn't have remained a mediocre actress up until this point if not for that Xie Tiansheng.‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu expressed her regrets through her words.\n\nIt was true, from Jin Xiaolu's point of view, Xia Muqing was a talented actress with limitless potential. She could have outperformed her sister, but Xia Muqing had rejected multiple offers for her to be promoted because of her husband, Xie Tiansheng as he was not fond of his wife exposing herself in public at all times! There was even a time when Xia Muqing had planned to retire from the entertainment field on an impulse due to Xie Tiansheng. But luckily enough, Jin Xiaolu was there to prevent her from making that decision, since being an actress was Muqing's lifelong dream after all.\n\n‚ÄúI'm sorry....‚Äù Muqing turned to face Jin Xiaolu and apologized to her. ‚ÄúYou could've become the manager of an actress that is far better than me, but you've never given up on me. For that, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, Xiaolu....‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu smiled. ‚ÄúThat's because I can foresee your value in the future! Muqing, have faith in me! Trust me when I say that you are going to reach the peak in the entertainment field and shine brighter than any other actress! But for that to happen, you first need to stop lowering your standards for that b, Xie Tiansheng! He's not someone that's worthy of your sacrifices.‚Äù\n\nRight beside her, Xie Muqing smiled faintly and said, ‚ÄúI'll try my best......‚Äù\n\nNot long after that, Muqing did achieve the highest peak in the entertainment field and shone brighter than any other actresses as Jin Xiaolu predicted. She managed to look down on Xie Tiansheng and his mistress from the pedestal built by her success. But of course, that was a story for another time.\n\nOn her fifth day in Japan, Muqing's private cell phone never rang. Xie Tiansheng had never called her, not even once.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng's existence was like a bacterium, infecting and munching down on her broken heart, and as the time went by, her wound worsened, leaving Muqing only with a pain that may overwhelm her soon.\n\nThat night, after a magazine photoshoot, Muqing excused herself from Xiaolu's monitoring by stating that she wanted some time alone to stroll around.\n\nMuqing walked around the streets of Japan aimlessly.

I'll be able to forget about all the painful memories when I'm drunk. Then I would not suffer any longer from the anguish.\n\nMuqing did not know how much alcohol she drank, but that was the first time she had downed so much at once. She gazed drowsily at the happenings inside the chaotic night club; some cute Japanese boys would come and strike up a conversation occasionally, but most of them were hosts that worked at the club.\n\nHowever, Muqing did not bother herself with the boys that wanted to chat with her.

    "description": "‚ÄúLet's get a divorce!‚Äù Xie Tiansheng said casually as he ground out the cigarette on the ashtray.\n\nHe crossed his legs and rested lazily on the sofa. He did not even bother to look at his wife, Xia Muqing whose face has ashened like all the blood has been drained from her face with her lips pursed tightly.\n\nWith nothing on his sexy and muscular body but a simple white towel wrapped around his lower body, a disgusting stench permeated and lingered around the air inside the room......\n\nThat stench was coming from the semen that had leaked onto the sheets of the messy bed.\n\nHowever, the woman that was on the receiving end of said semen was not Xia Muqing!\n\nShe did not know who was the other woman that was on the bed. But Xia Muqing's eyes were met with such a revolting scene as she entered Xie Tiansheng's office to bring him some snacks.\n\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Xia Muqing questioned Xie Tiansheng with a trembling voice.\n\nXie Tiansheng slowly lifted his gaze and met with Xia Muqing's face at long last. That man's eyes were pensive as he spoke in a dissatisfied tone. ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter who she is. What matters the most is that we are getting a divorce!‚Äù\n\nMuqing's grip tightened around the reusable bag in her hand and was stunned for a moment.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes. ‚ÄúXie Tiansheng, what is marriage to you? Who am I to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, stop embarrassing yourself, you should know better that you're nothing to me!!! I wouldn't have married you if not for the sake of the Xie family!‚Äù\n\nSo, the only reason he married me was because he wanted to utilize my family's influence to assist his own family? Is that why he's reluctant to caress my body even after 2 years of marriage?! That's why he wanted our marriage to be held privately without being known to the public.\n\nMuqing's hands were shaking as she could not contain her tears from falling continuously......\n\n‚ÄúAlright! Is that what you wanted? You wanted a divorce, Xie Tiansheng? I will grant you your wish......‚Äù Xia Muqing forced herself to speak with a steely voice, but her voice came out trembling.\n\nXie Tiansheng was astounded by her alacrity. He curled his sexy lips the next second and said, ‚ÄúVery well! I'll see you tomorrow at 9 o'clock in the morning in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI'll see you then!‚Äù Xia Muqing's fists tightened.\n\nShe turned around and stepped out of the office immediately. There was absolutely not a chance that she could stand being inside that room with the heavy and unbearable atmosphere, if she had stayed any longer, the pressure inside the room would surely suffocate her!\n\nHowever, tears started streaming down her cheeks like a broken dam as soon as she slammed the door shut.\n\nXia Muqing curled her body inside the cramp space of the elevator and like an abandoned child, she cried hysterically in anguish.\n\n‚ÄúDing-‚Äù Her ringtone reverberated inside the elevator as the relentless sound stung her ears.\n\nShe did not want to answer the call, but the other person was determined to dial her number until Xia Muqing answered the call. Finally, she picked up her phone as she could no longer bear with the annoying ringtone.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, where are you?‚Äù It was her manager as well as her best friend, Jin Xiaolu that called her.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu......‚Äù Muqing held her phone tightly and choked out her words like a pitiful child. ‚ÄúXiaolu, Tiansheng is dumping me. He's going to ditch me for real this time.... (sound of whimpering)‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu was silent for a few seconds as she listened to Muqing's sobs.\n\n‚ÄúThat heartless man!‚Äù An angry curse was heard through the speaker.\n\n‚ÄúStop crying, my baby girl. I've told you that the b wasn't even a real man! You should've parted ways with him in the past. Listen to me, I've just received a phone call from my company. They informed me that we'll be working outstation in Japan for the upcoming month! We're boarding the international flight at 7 o'clock in the morning tomorrow.‚Äù Jin Xiaolu had always held great passion for her occupation.\n\n‚ÄúXiaolu, I've agreed to meet with him at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing wanted to reject Xiaolu's arrangements to work outstation in Japan. She knew that she would not be able to focus on her work under such conditions.\n\nJin Xiaolu kept quiet for a long time before she spoke again. ‚ÄúMuqing, I hope that you'll reconsider this matter thoroughly before you make a sound decision. I know that you've always wanted to become Xie Tiansheng's wife in the last 2 years, but that man has rejected you now. You should start thinking for yourself. This trip to Japan would be a great steppingstone for your career advancement. Also, you can sign the divorce paper at any time. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, am I right? Mull this over then only make up your mind!‚Äù\n\nAt 10 o'clock in the night, Muqing returned to the empty and deserted home as usual.\n\nHer husband did not come home after all.\n\nShe quickly filled the fridge with all kinds of staple food, fruits and drinks that Xie Tiansheng consumed on a daily basis.\n\nAfter she was done prepping in the kitchen, she went upstairs into that man's room.\n\nShe wanted to prepare a month's worth of that man's outfit for him because she had to leave the country to Japan for outstation work. Xia Muqing did not want her husband to be worried about his daily lives when she's not around the home to serve him.\n\nOnce she was done, Muqing put on a contented smile.\n\nXie Tiansheng would not abandon an obedient and caring wife like me, right? So, he must've proposed that divorce out of anger, am I right? I cannot perceive that proposition as his true intention! Xia Muqing comforted herself in her own mind.\n\nXia Muqing dialed her husband's number at that thought. No one picked up the call initially, but the call connected after some time. The sound of a couple making love and moaning persistently was heard through the speaker.\n\nA woman was twisting her alluring figure relentlessly on a man's body as she complained. ‚ÄúTiansheng, your ringtone is killing the mood!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGo and fetch my phone over. Switch off that damn phone!‚Äù said Xie Tiansheng as he slapped the woman's round buttocks.\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù The woman got up from his body and tiptoed towards the sofa to pick up the phone. She spoke with a coquettish smile. ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do? It's a call from your wife.‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng's face darkened. He corrected the woman. ‚ÄúShe's my ex-wife now!‚Äù\n\nThe woman smiled. ‚ÄúShould I hang up the call then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo need for that. Just answer the call!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou want me to answer the call?‚Äù The woman replied, obviously aghast at his suggestion.\n\n‚ÄúWhat's the matter? Are you afraid that she'll recognize your voice?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng smiled impishly at the woman.\n\nBut the woman smiled skittishly and said, ‚ÄúWell, she's going to know about us anyway!‚Äù\n\nShe swiped the screen and received the call as she strode towards that man with her pair of slender and fair-skinned legs.\n\n‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Xia Muqing's gentle voice can be heard through the speaker. At the same time, the woman had positioned herself brazenly on Xie Tiansheng's muscular hips and moaned flirtatiously.\n\n‚ÄúAh...‚Äù The sexual moans penetrated Xia Muqing's auditory sense. Her pale face flushed red at that instant.\n\n‚ÄúI. I'm looking for Xie Tiansheng...‚Äù Muqing's voice was trembling, and her hand that was holding the phone was trembling violently.\n\n‚ÄúHe's very busy right now! You can talk to me instead. I'm his fianc√©e....‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAhh.... Tiansheng, slow down for a bit... slow down... ahhhh....‚Äù The woman's voice coupled with a man's labored breathing washed over Xia Muqing as she listened to the sound originating from the other end of the phone.\n\nXia Muqing felt a heart-wrenching pain as if someone was tearing her heart into pieces.\n\nFianc√©e? He's already found a backup wife for himself before we even finalize our divorce?\n\nMuqing took a deep breath and suppressed her urge to break down in tears. ‚ÄúPlease tell Xie Tiansheng that I won't be able to make it to the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXia Muqing strained herself to finish that sentence. She hung up the phone before she received any response from the other end of the call.\n\nTears fell from her cheeks, and her fragile body slumped onto the cold hard floor in despair. She covered her face with her hands and broke down in tears the next second.\n\nXie Tiansheng, what did I do to wrong you for you to treat me like this! I've poured all my sincerity to love you and what did I receive in return? Did you even cherish my affection towards you for just a single moment throughout our marriage?!\n\nAt 2 o'clock in the midnight, Muqing froze for a split second as she sat on the sofa in a daze when the sound of someone unlocking the door was heard.\n\nShe then forced herself to put on a smile and without even putting on her shoes, she walked barefooted and welcomed the man that had entered the door.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, you're back!‚Äù A hint of obedience and joy filled her gleaming eyes.\n\nMuqing thought that her husband would never return home again. She thought that Xie Tiansheng would not want to even see her again on their last night as a married couple. But he came home after all.\n\nXie Tiansheng was startled by Xia Muqing's passionate greetings. He was stunned for a second but quickly put on a frown. Then he entered the house and disregarded the woman's enthusiasm. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, we must sign the divorce paper tomorrow!‚Äù\n\nThe smile on Xia Muqing's face stiffened. Then she spoke with a diminished voice. ‚ÄúI'm not free tomorrow....‚Äù\n\nXie Tiansheng turned around and fixed his cold stare on the woman. Then he scoffed, ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I knew! You're not willing to cut ties with me!‚Äù\n\nMuqing took a deep breath to suppress her tears and forced her pretty lips into a faint smile. ‚ÄúTiansheng, let's not talk about this for now, please?‚Äù\n\nDeep down in her heart, Muqing had to admit that she was not willing to let go of their relationship, just yet.\n\nXie Tiansheng looked at her with a face filled with disgust. He moved closer to Xia Muqing in just a few steps.\n\nWith his long fingers, he clasped Muqing tightly on her chin, causing Muqing to frown slightly due to the pain from the unrestrained force that he had exerted on her delicate face.\n\nWith a tone full of mockery, Xie Tiansheng spoke. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, did you not listen to that phone call earlier? Are you really going to ignore everything that you've heard? You're such an undignified woman for throwing away the last hint of self-respect towards yourself. You're such a pitiful person!‚Äù\n\nHis cruel words stabbed mercilessly through her heart like a sharp knife.\n\nMuqing's shoulder shuddered due to the physical and emotional pain that was inflicted upon her.\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, are you still hoping that I, Xie Tiansheng will still love you? Let me tell you this again, I have never loved you and I never will! All I feel is disgust towards you!‚Äù\n\nTears fell from the corner of her eyes as Muqing could no longer suppress her grievances.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng did not even look at her but only turned around and headed upstairs on his own.\n\nDriven by insanity, Xia Muqing emptied the content of the fridge and tossed all the items into the rubbish bin in the middle of the night at 2am.\n\nOne by one, she tossed them all into the bin disdainfully without feeling any reluctance, just like how Xia Tiansheng had ditched her sincerity and trampled all over her affection towards him......\n\nAt 5 o'clock in the early morning, Xia Muqing had left the house with her luggage while Xie Tiansheng was still sound asleep.\n\nJin Xiaolu and her assistant had been waiting for Xia Muqing in front of her house in their exclusive MPV.\n\nThe moment Jin Xiaolu saw the depressive look and ashen face of Xia Muqing, she was stunned. But quickly, she regained back her senses and hurried over to help carry her luggage.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, cheer up! Think of this 1-month trip to Japan as our holiday!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù Muqing responded with an obscured smile.\n\nAt 7 o'clock sharp in the morning, the plane was ready to take off.\n\nJin Xiaolu wanted to talk about their 1-month business trip itinerary with Muqing, but she refrained herself from doing so after noticing Muqing's dampened mood.\n\nHence, Jin Xiaolu set aside the documents and sighed to herself before she comforted Xia Muqing. ‚ÄúTo be honest, Muqing, I'm really happy for you when you said that you're finally going to divorce that b, Xie Tiansheng!‚Äù\n\nHer words instantly touched Muqing's stone-cold heart, but she stuck her face onto the window without giving Jin Xiaolu any reply.\n\n‚ÄúMuqing, you could've reached the same height in your career as your sister, Zhi, if not for this shallow marriage that had restricted your progress. You wouldn't have remained a mediocre actress up until this point if not for that Xie Tiansheng.‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu expressed her regrets through her words.\n\nIt was true, from Jin Xiaolu's point of view, Xia Muqing was a talented actress with limitless potential. She could have outperformed her sister, but Xia Muqing had rejected multiple offers for her to be promoted because of her husband, Xie Tiansheng as he was not fond of his wife exposing herself in public at all times! There was even a time when Xia Muqing had planned to retire from the entertainment field on an impulse due to Xie Tiansheng. But luckily enough, Jin Xiaolu was there to prevent her from making that decision, since being an actress was Muqing's lifelong dream after all.\n\n‚ÄúI'm sorry....‚Äù Muqing turned to face Jin Xiaolu and apologized to her. ‚ÄúYou could've become the manager of an actress that is far better than me, but you've never given up on me. For that, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, Xiaolu....‚Äù\n\nJin Xiaolu smiled. ‚ÄúThat's because I can foresee your value in the future! Muqing, have faith in me! Trust me when I say that you are going to reach the peak in the entertainment field and shine brighter than any other actress! But for that to happen, you first need to stop lowering your standards for that b, Xie Tiansheng! He's not someone that's worthy of your sacrifices.‚Äù\n\nRight beside her, Xie Muqing smiled faintly and said, ‚ÄúI'll try my best......‚Äù\n\nNot long after that, Muqing did achieve the highest peak in the entertainment field and shone brighter than any other actresses as Jin Xiaolu predicted. She managed to look down on Xie Tiansheng and his mistress from the pedestal built by her success. But of course, that was a story for another time.\n\nOn her fifth day in Japan, Muqing's private cell phone never rang. Xie Tiansheng had never called her, not even once.\n\nHowever, Xie Tiansheng's existence was like a bacterium, infecting and munching down on her broken heart, and as the time went by, her wound worsened, leaving Muqing only with a pain that may overwhelm her soon.\n\nThat night, after a magazine photoshoot, Muqing excused herself from Xiaolu's monitoring by stating that she wanted some time alone to stroll around.\n\nMuqing walked around the streets of Japan aimlessly. After a while, she stopped abruptly in front of a lively night club.\n\nXia Muqing fell into a trance as she stared at the heated atmosphere inside the club through the glass window and entered the night club unwittingly.\n\nPerhaps I should get drunk for once. I'll be able to forget about all the painful memories when I'm drunk. Then I would not suffer any longer from the anguish.\n\nMuqing did not know how much alcohol she drank, but that was the first time she had downed so much at once. She gazed drowsily at the happenings inside the chaotic night club; some cute Japanese boys would come and strike up a conversation occasionally, but most of them were hosts that worked at the club.\n\nHowever, Muqing did not bother herself with the boys that wanted to chat with her. She took out her phone and dialed Xie Tiansheng's number daringly under the influence of alcohol.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, what are you doing?‚Äù She sobbed and asked the man through the phone.\n\nWith a cold and indifferent attitude, Xie Tiansheng said ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I'm very busy right now, talk to my assistant if you have anything to say to me!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you busy in the middle of the night......‚Äù Muqing started to throw a tantrum as the alcohol disrupted her normal thought process. ‚ÄúYou're always telling me to talk to your assistant!! Xie Tiansheng, I married you, not your assistant!‚Äù sobbed Muqing.\n\n‚ÄúXia Muqing, are you drunk right now?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng sounded serious all of the sudden.\n\nMuqing sensed the change in his tone and felt a leap of joy in her heart.\n\n‚ÄúTiansheng, I know that you're still worried about me......‚Äù Muqing smiled contentedly.\n\n‚ÄúWorried?‚Äù Xie Tiansheng sneered. ‚ÄúXia Muqing, I just wanted to remind you that you should be looking for someone else if you wanted to act crazy after you're drunk! I'm very busy, so don't ever bother me again! I'm going to sleep now!‚Äù\n\n.........................................\nGo to Lilacnovel to search for the title \"Girl, Life Turns Around\"\nRead more exciting content immediately ;)",

    "description": "After a one-night stand, she got pregnant, 5 yrs later, she met her child's father...\n.........................................\nThe noisy bar was full of people. Under the colorful flashing lights, men and women gyrated on the dance floor, setting their emotions free.\n\nA figure snaked through the crowd. Wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans, her hair tied up in a simple ponytail; she looked about twenty, like a college student.\n\nHer name was Su Luoli, and she had almost been bowled over by the sheer noise when she first entered.\n\nHer naivety was completely out of place in these surroundings.\n\nIt was her first time coming to a place like this, and it took her a few minutes before she oriented herself.\n\nAt this time yesterday, she had used an ovulation test to check when she would be ovulating in the next 24 to 48 hours, and now was the time!\n\nYes, she was in this place today because she wanted a baby.\n\nShe knew that the \"old man\" at home was never going to get her pregnant. Moreover, he had left her at the villa for a whole year. So she would have to find someone else to get pregnant with.\n\nEven though having this baby was her last resort, no one wanted their child to lose out in the looks department, so she needed to find the right target.\n\nSu Luoli bit her bottom lip and scanned the men around her with her almond eyes. The one sitting at the bar caught her eye.\n\nHe was facing away from her and she could only see his profile, but that profile charmed her entirely!\n\nThose delicate features, especially that high nose bridge, those thin lips, and the eyelashes so long they left a shadow under his eyes.\n\nHe looked mixed.\n\nThe sapphire earring in his left ear sparkled under the brilliant lights, mesmerizing her.\n\nSu Luoli took a deep breath. Her heart felt like it was going to jump out of her mouth. She had never done this before and she could not help but be nervous.\n\nShe mimicked the way the seniors in school picked up girls and tapped the man's shoulder. \"Hi!\"\n\nThe man turned to her. It did not matter which way he turned; his profile was enough to capture her heart, but from the front he was almost too handsome to bear!\n\nHis light blue eyes were so charming!\n\nSu Luoli was so lost in her admiration of this handsome man that she stood stunned for a while!\n\n\"Why are you so late?!\" The man seemed a bit angry. He stood up, grabbing Su Luoli's wrist, and walked out. Su Luoli had no idea what was happening!\n\nShe only knew that he was strong. Her wrist felt like it would shatter in his grip!\n\nThe man walk straight to the hotel next door, where everything seemed to be already prepared. He headed straight to the presidential suite on the third floor, and opened the door with a keycard. The whole process was smooth.\n\nOnce inside, the man stripped off his white T-shirt, revealing his tanned chest.\n\nSu Luoli sucked in a breath. This man's figure was too good to be true!\n\nA well-defined broad chest with every muscle perfect, and not a trace of fat on his body, especially those alluring abs.\n\nNot only was his face bewitching, his body too!\n\nShe almost had a nosebleed!\n\nAfter taking off his T-shirt, the man proceeded to remove his belt.\n\nSu Luoli's eyes widened, almost able to see what lay below his waist. She immediately stepped forward to grab the hand that was removing the belt. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe man frowned slightly, narrowing his blue eyes and asked, \"What?\"\n\n\"Isn't this a bit too fast?\" Su Luoli laughed, her cheeks red.\n\n\"Fast? Is it?\" The man have Su Luoli a once-over, taking in the flush across her small and beautiful face. She became shy as he looked at her, and she averted her gaze.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. I should flirt first.\" The man let go of his belt and walked into the bedroom, calling out, \"Say anything you wish.\"\n\nHe switched on the light in the bedroom and Su Luoli entered timidly.\n\nThen, as silence fell between them, the man began to really look at Su Luoli.\n\nA standard oval face that was a bit thin, with a pointed chin and some natural baby fat on her cheeks. She looked cute and pretty, and gave off a comfortable aura.\n\nUnder her arched eyebrows, her crystal clear eyes were like obsidian, giving off an alluring glow. Her eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings, and they drew him in.\n\nBut maybe‚Ä¶ her breasts were a bit small?\n\nIt might have been his first time, but he had often listened to Ye Bin speak about women. Even without any experience with women, he had eyes too. He knew about the type of women who sought out men for sex!\n\n\"Ye Bin. He said he'd find a good one, but he's taken them for himself!\" the man muttered.\n\n\"Huh? What did you say?\" Su Luoli did not catch what he had just said.\n\n\"Nothing. Don't you want to flirt? Don't just stand there like an idiot. Say something!\"\n\nThe man had a powerful voice with a commanding attitude.\n\nHis name was Wen Qingmu.\n\nIn Z City, this was a familiar name to many.\n\nThe founder and current CEO of the Dark Empire, and an all-powerful and omnipotent person.\n\nRumor had it that Wen Qingmu was a genius gamer. He had started out in the gaming industry, and the games he created had monopolized the whole market. After that, Dark Empire expanded rapidly, developing beyond the game industry into many other industries. This also led to a rapid growth in Wen Qingmu's wealth.\n\nAt just twenty-six, he was one of a handful of the richest people, not just domestically, but internationally.\n\nHowever, he never made any public appearances and no one had ever seen him.\n\nSu Luoli gulped. \"I‚Ä¶ I have one request.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Wen Qingmu was beginning to look impatient.\n\n\"No condom.\"\n\nAt this, Wen Qingmu‚Äôs jaw almost fell to the floor!\n\nYe Bin had been very clear on this, always wear a condom!\n\nFor one, due to his special status, it would be a problem if there was an accidental pregnancy. For another, who knew where these women had been; he did not want to catch anything.\n\n\"Why!\" Wen Qingmu fixed his sinister gaze on Su Luoli, unnerving her.\n\n\"Because‚Ä¶\" Su Luoli did not want to bring up the fact that she wanted a baby. She had been hoping to get pregnant quietly and without any trouble.\n\n\"If you don't explain, I'm not going to touch you!\" Wen Qingmu said coldly.\n\nSu Luoli did not want to miss out on this chance and lose out on the man in front of her. Where else could she find such good genes!\n\nIn for a dime, in for a dollar!\n\n\"Because I want a baby!\"\n\nWen Qingmu was shocked yet again!\n\nThis woman looked barely out of her twenties, and she wanted a baby?\n\nWas‚Ä¶ was she alright in the head?\n\n\"Why‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"Don't worry! I'll never come after you! I'll take care of the baby myself! We won't have anything to do with your money!\"\n\nSu Luoli swore immediately.\n\nWen Qingmu once again suspected that this woman was not alright in the head.\n\nSu Luoli could see that Wen Qingmu was still doubtful, and she gathered her courage to sit next to him. \"I'm a trustworthy person. I have special reasons for wanting this baby. After today, we won't have anything to do with each other. Even if we see each other in the street, we can act as if we've never met before!\"\n\n\"Why do you want a baby?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you that,\" Su Luoli said, shaking her head.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, then she cast her eyes down. \"Um‚Ä¶that‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶this is my first time, so‚Ä¶if you could take the lead‚Ä¶\"\n\nShe was a virgin!\n\nThis excited Wen Qingmu!\n\nBut it was his first time too; he did not have any experience! Ye Bin said that tonight was when he would lose that status!\n\nHe had not expected Ye Bin to find him a virgin. Was he deliberately giving him trouble?\n\nHe would settle things with Ye Bin tomorrow.\n\nSu Luoli peeked at Wen Qingmu. \"Okay‚Ä¶ You can start.\"\n\nSaying it was one thing, but the two of them sat there unmoving, and the atmosphere was quite awkward.\n\nWen Qingmu cleared his throat. \"I'll take the lead, but can you take the initiative to kiss me?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Women's flirting is more interesting, otherwise it would be boring.\"\n\n\"Well‚Ä¶okay.\"\n\nSu Luoli nodded and slowly moved to Wen Qingmu's side. She looked up at him.\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\nHis blue eyes were dreamy, fulfilling the expectations that all girls have of their Prince Charming.\n\nHe felt his throat tighten at her blushing face.\n\nSu Luoli inched slowly toward Wen Qingmu.\n\nFive centimeters, four centimeters, three centimeters, two centimeters‚Ä¶\n\nShe shut her eyes and went for it, kissing Wen Qingmu on the lips.\n\nWen Qingmu, who had never been kissed before, was surprised!\n\nHer lips were soft and their damp warmth stunned him. He immediately reacted and kissed her back.\n\nThe unexpected kiss surprised Su Luoli. Her eye widened and chest suddenly felt tight and numb.\n\nWen Qingmu shoved his hand under Su Luoli's shirt and groped at her impatiently, then with a ripping sound, tore her clothes off.\n\nWen Qingmu pushed her down under him.\n\nEven though she had prepared herself mentally, when the time came, Su Luoli was still as panicked as a deer in headlights.\n\n\"Again!\" Wen Qingmu wanted more, but as he pulled Su Luoli over to him, he saw that she had passed out.\n\nThis disappointed Wen Qingmu somewhat. He was still interested in more, but she was asleep!\n\nWen Qingmu sat up with a 'tsk'. Standing up, he looked over at the sleeping Su Luoli and observed her beautiful body.\n\nHer breasts were small, but besides that, there was nothing wrong with this woman's body.\n\nMore importantly, it suited him.\n\nJust then, Wen Qingmu's phone rang. Picking it up, he saw that, coincidentally, it was Ye Bin.\n\n\"F you, I have something to settle with you!\"\n\nWen Qingmu had just spoken, when an impatient voice said back to him, \"Bro! Weren't you the one nagging me about giving up your virginity after twenty-six years? I found someone, but where are you?!\"\n\n\"I'm in the hotel!\"\n\n\"Why are you in the hotel? Weren't you supposed to wait in the bar? Our girl has been waiting a full two hours for you! Get there now!\"\n\n\"What girl? Isn't she on my‚Ä¶\" Bed?\n\nWen Qingmu glanced at the naked Su Luoli on the bed.\n\nDamn!\n\nHe must have got the wrong person!\n\nIf the girl Ye Bin had found him was still in the bar, then who was this on the bed?!\n\n\"Hurry and go to the bar! I guarantee that the girl I've got you is way better than your wife at home by a thousand times!\" Ye Bin continued.\n\nSu Luoli woke up the next morning at around nine. As she got up, her body felt like it had been ripped apart, and as if she had been crushed. Everywhere hurt.\n\nThat man was too rough last night!\n\nShe could barely stand it.\n\nShe pushed herself up into a sitting position, and her legs trembled slightly as she got off the bed.\n\nIt was only after a shower that she discovered the bruises all over her body; some were made by fingers and some were hickeys.\n\n\"Pervert!\" Su Luoli muttered, as she discovered her clothes had been torn apart by that man. She had no choice but to seek help from the hotel staff.\n\nLuckily, this was the presidential suite and the service was impeccable.\n\nDressed in clothes borrowed from the staff, she quickly left.\n\nDark Empire CEO office.\n\nThe well-decorated office was clean and tidy. Nothing was out of place and no defects could be found.\n\nThere were three computers on the curved desk.\n\nWen Qingmu sat at the desk, but all the monitors were dark. He had no mood to work since this morning; all his thoughts were on the woman he had mistakenly slept with last night.\n\nHis secretary Yin Jin walked in. \"Mr. Wen, you were looking for me.\"\n\nYin Jin was the head of Wen Qingmu's secretaries. At twenty-eight, he had joined Dark Empire straight out of university, and was considered one of Wen Qingmu's senior employees.\n\n\"Investigate someone for me.\" Wen Qingmu pulled up a photo on his phone.\n\nThe photo was of Su Luoli. Last night, Wen Qingmu had taken a photo of Su Luoli's naked body, but the version he showed Yin Jin was cropped. He was not going to show a naked photo of the woman he slept with to anyone!\n\nYin Jin stepped forward to take Wen Qingmu's phone. His eyes immediately widened!\n\n\"Ma...ma...ma‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"Ma‚Äîwhat? Find out everything about this woman!\" Wen Qingmu ordered with a frown.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, isn't this Madam?\" Yin Jin managed to calm himself.\n\nYin Jin had singlehandedly arranged Wen Qingmu's marriage, so naturally, he had seen Su Luoli before.\n\n\"Madam?\" Wen Qingmu was confused.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, have you forgotten? A year ago, you and Madam registered your marriage, and you arranged to have her stay in the Rainbow City villa.\n\nWen Qingmu slammed both hands on the table with a bang and stood up. He fixed his sinister gaze on Yin Jin. \"You're saying that the woman in this photo is my wife?!\"\n\nWen Qingmu had never seen Su Luoli before. He had not even wanted this marriage business, so he had not even attended the marriage registration.\n\nWhile people usually needed to be physically present for a marriage registration, the government employees had not dared to do anything because of who he was!\n\nTherefore, until now, he did not know what his wife looked like, and had even forgotten that he was even married!\n\nYin Jin had no idea why Wen Qingmu was suddenly incensed. Back straight, he took two steps back and nodded. \"Yes‚Ä¶sir.\"\n\nWen Qingmu took two harsh breaths and sat down again!\n\nThis meant that his wife had been cheating on him last night!\n\nThat woman!\n\nEven though in a strange twist of fate, it had ended up being him she had slept with, what if she had met someone else? He would have been cheated on?!\n\n\"Mr.‚ÄîMr. Wen, you mentioned everything about Madam. A year ago, when you got married, I already completed the investigation. Shall I get it for you?\"\n\n\"Well hurry up about it!\" Wen Qingmu shouted at Yin Jin.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Yin Jin hurried out of the office. Five minutes later, he was back with Su Luoli's information.\n\nThank goodness for his habit of keeping information. Otherwise, their mighty CEO might explode today!\n\nIt was just one sheet of A4 paper and Wen Qingmu's eyes narrowed. \"Is this a joke? That's all?!\"\n\nYin Jin bowed deeply, barely daring to take a deep breath. \"Yes sir, at the time, you also felt that Madam's background was very clean. That's why you agreed to marry her.\"\n\nWen Qingmu had completely forgotten all of this and scanned through the paper.\n\nSu Luoli, twenty-one, third-year performance major at Z University's Academy of Film.\n\nFather: Su Kun. Mother: Wang Bangxiang.\n\nYounger brother: Su Jianmo.\n\nYounger half-sister: Su Ruoyun.\n\nYounger half-brother: Su Ruoyao.\n\nTheir Su Winery had been passed down the generations, but it was not doing well and facing closure.\n\nThe rest was an introduction of Su Luoli, but it was all irrelevant and only half of the paper was used.\n\n\"Su Luoli‚Ä¶\" Wen Qingmu read the name out. So her name was Su Luoli.\n\nThis was last year's information, so she would be twenty-two this ahead and graduating soon.\n\nEven though this woman had given him enjoyment last night, allowing him to taste the beauty of a first time, when he thought about her running around cheating on him, it maddened him!\n\n\"Where is she now?\" Wen Qingmu raised his head.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, as you instructed, she was settled in the Rainbow City villa. She doesn't live there often, and sometimes stays on campus or visits her brother. Now‚Ä¶ Now it's May, so she should be graduating.\"\n\nYin Jin's nervous answer was very detailed.\n\n\"A villa for her and she runs around all the time!\" Wen Qingmu crushed the A4 sheet into a ball and threw it into the trash can!\n\nIt seemed like she had been planning to cheat on him!\n\nHowever, she had not managed to, because he knew last night was her first time.\n\nYe Bin said that women would bleed if it was their first time, and he saw traces of blood on the white sheets yesterday.\n\n\"Is there anyone else in Rainbow City?\"\n\n\"There's a maid there to take care of Madam. A girl of about twenty.\"\n\n\"Tell her that I'm coming home tonight.\"\n\nYin Jin froze. He had not gone back for one year and now he suddenly wanted to?\n\nNevertheless, he did not ask more. Once Wen Qingmu was angry, it was better to do as he said.\n\nZ University's Academy of Film.\n\nIt was May and Su Luoli was about to graduate. Balancing a graduation thesis and work, she was extremely busy.\n\nShe had been tossed around roughly by that man last night, and had gone home to rest for a while, but she still dragged her tired body to campus. She needed more data and was going to head straight to the library.\n\nA red Maserati stopped right in front of her, its brakes attracting the attention of many people around.\n\nThe car door opened and revealed a pair of red heels, followed closely by a beautiful pair of legs, and finally, Su Luoli saw her.\n\nHer younger sister, Su Ruoyun.\n\n\"Woah, look it's Su Ruoyun. That's a sweet sports car!\"\n\n\"Of course! Her boyfriend is the CEO of Yixin International. She's already signed to them. It's only a matter of time before she becomes famous!\"\n\nThe envious voices of the people around were in full discussion.\n\nSu Luoli did not want to cross her path, so she pretended not to notice and was about to head towards the library when that familiar voice called out.\n\n\"Hey Sis! Long time no see!\" Su Ruoyun took off her sunglasses and casually waved at Su Luoli.\n\nSu Luoli shut her eyes and took a deep breath before turning around, a blinding smile that did not reach her eyes plastered on her face. \"Yes, long time no see, what a coincidence.\"\n\nMany graduates from the academy had gone on to become future celebrities, and Su Ruoyun had already become a star since her second year.\n\nShe used to practice aerobics and had even represented the school in international competitions. After that, she had chosen to major in performance, and had signed with Yixin International. To many people, she was already a rising star!\n\nHer appearance naturally drew a lot of attention and everyone came over.\n\n\"Su Ruoyun has a sister?\" someone asked carefully.\n\n\"Oh yes, I heard that Su Ruoyun can do anything, and her sister can't do anything! They're both performance majors, but Su Ruoyun always plays the lead and her sister has small roles!\"\n\nListening to the comments of the people nearby, Su Luoli felt a bitter taste in her heart.\n\n\"It's so good to see you today. Yi and I will be getting engaged soon, you must come then.\"\n\n\"Oh really? It's been a while hasn't it?\" Su Luoli could not help but scoff in disdain.\n\nThis provoked Su Ruoyun and her expression turned ugly, but she quickly became snooty again.\n\n\"Oh yes, the Murongs are such a big family that these things take a while. But don't worry, you'll be attending our wedding banquet very soon.\"\n\nSu Ruoyun was full of arrogance. She felt she had the right to lord her superiority over Su Luoli.\n\nAfter all, Murong Yi used to be Su Luoli's.\n\nSu Luoli did not show the slightest bit of sadness. \"Sure, I'll drink more then. I can't waste all the effort that my baby sister put into my future brother-in-law!\"\n\nOf course, Su Ruoyun knew that Su Luoli's words had a hidden meaning. Su Luoli had always been good with words, and now that she had been defeated by her, that was all Su Luoli was reduced to.\n\n\"Sis, I heard that no company wants to sign you and you're still playing small roles. Perhaps I can ask Yi to help you?\"\n\n\"There's no need, I can find a company to sign to myself. If there's nothing else, I'm going to the library.\"\n\nSu Luoli shot her a disdainful glance and started to turn away.\n\n\"I know you're unhappy! You should have taken better care of him!\" Su Ruoyun did not want her to have the last word.\n\nJust as Su Luoli turned away, a sapphire blue sports car zoomed over and came to a screeching halt in front of them.\n\nIt was a Ferrari LaFerrari!\n\nUnder the light of the sun, this sapphire blue Ferrari LaFerrari was like a predator in waiting, full of murderous intent!\n.........................................\nGo to Flipread to search for the title \"Her Bossy Yet Naive CEO\"\nRead more exciting content immediately ;)",

    "description": "After a one-night stand, she got pregnant, 5 yrs later, she met her child's father...\n.........................................\nPrologue\n\nMy fingers shook like leaves in the breeze as I raised them, my heartbeat hummingbird quick. Luca‚Äôs strong hand was firm and steady as he took mine and slipped the ring onto my finger.\n\nWhite gold with twenty small diamonds.\n\nWhat was meant as a sign of love and devotion for other couples was nothing but a testament of his ownership of me. A daily reminder of the golden cage I‚Äôd be trapped in for the rest of my life. Until death do us part wasn‚Äôt an empty promise as with so many other couples that entered the holy bond of marriage. There was no way out of this union for me. I was Luca‚Äôs until the bitter end. The last few words of the oath that men swore when they were inducted into the mafia could just as well have been the closing of my wedding vow:\n\n‚ÄúI enter alive and I will have to get out dead.‚Äù\n\nI should have run when I still had the chance. Now, as hundreds of faces from the Chicago and New York Familias stared back at us, flight was no longer an option. Nor was divorce. Death was the only acceptable end to a marriage in our world. Even if I still managed to escape Luca‚Äôs watchful eyes and that of his henchmen, my breach of our agreement would mean war. Nothing my father could say would prevent Luca‚Äôs Familia from exercising vengeance for making them lose face.\n\nMy feelings didn‚Äôt matter, never had. I‚Äôd been growing up in a world where no choices were given, especially to women.\n\nThis wedding wasn‚Äôt about love or trust or choice. It was about duty and honor, about doing what was expected.\n\nA bond to ensure peace.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt an idiot. I knew what else this was about: money and power. Both were dwindling since the Russian Mob ‚ÄòThe Bratva‚Äô, the Taiwanese Triad, and other crime organizations had been trying to expand their influence into our territories. The Italian Familias across the US needed to lay their feuds to rest and work together to beat down their enemies. I should be honored to marry the oldest son of the New York Familia. That‚Äôs what my father and every other male relative had tried to tell me since my betrothal to Luca. I knew that, and it wasn‚Äôt as if I hadn‚Äôt had time to prepare for this exact moment, and yet fear corseted my body in a relentless grip.\n\n‚ÄúYou may kiss the bride,‚Äù the priest said.\n\nI raised my head. Every pair of eyes in the pavilion scrutinized me, waiting for a flicker of weakness. Father would be furious if I let my terror show, and Luca‚Äôs Familia would use it against us. But I had grown up in a world where a perfect mask was the only protection afforded to women and had no trouble forcing my face into a placid expression. Nobody would know how much I wanted to escape. Nobody but Luca. I couldn‚Äôt hide from him, no matter how much I tried. My body wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking. As my gaze met Luca‚Äôs cold gray eyes, I could tell that he knew. How often had he instilled fear in others? Recognizing it was probably second nature to him.\n\nHe bent down to bridge the ten inches he towered over me. There was no sign of hesitation, fear or doubt on his face. My lips trembled against his mouth as his eyes bored into me. Their message was clear: You are mine.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThree years prior\n\nI was curled up on the chaise longue in our library, reading, when a knock sounded. Liliana‚Äôs head rested in my lap and she didn‚Äôt even stir when the dark wooden door opened and our mother stepped in, her dark blond hair pulled back tightly and fasted in a bun at the back of her head. Mother was pale, her face drawn with worry.\n\n‚ÄúDid something happen?‚Äù I asked.\n\nShe smiled, but it was her fake smile. ‚ÄúYour father wants to talk to you in his office.‚Äù\n\nI carefully moved out from under Lily‚Äôs head and put it down on the chaise. She drew her legs up against her body. She was small for an eleven year old, but I wasn‚Äôt exactly tall either with five foot four. None of the women in our family were. Mother avoided my eyes as I walked toward her.\n\n‚ÄúAm I in trouble?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what I could have done wrong. Usually Lily and I were the obedient ones; Gianna was the one who always broke the rules and got punished.\n\n‚ÄúHurry. Don‚Äôt let your father wait,‚Äù Mother said simply.\n\nMy stomach was in knots when I arrived in front of Father‚Äôs office. After a moment to stifle my nerves, I knocked.\n\n‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù\n\nI entered, forcing my face to be carefully guarded. Father sat behind his mahogany desk in a wide black leather armchair; behind him rose the mahogany shelves filled with books that Father had never read, but they hid a secret entrance to the basement and a corridor leading off the premises.\n\nHe looked up from a pile of sheets, grey hair slicked back. ‚ÄúSit.‚Äù\n\nI sank down on one of the chairs across from his desk and folded my hands in my lap, trying not to gnaw on my lower lip. Father hated that. I waited for him to start talking. He had a strange expression on his face as he scrutinized me. ‚ÄúThe Bratva and the Triad are trying to claim our territories. They are getting bolder by the day. We‚Äôre luckier than the Las Vegas familia who also has to deal with the Mexicans but we can‚Äôt ignore the threat the Russians and the Taiwanese pose any longer.‚Äù\n\nConfusion filled me. Father never talked about business to us. Girls didn‚Äôt need to know about the finer details of the mob business. I knew better than to interrupt him.\n\n‚ÄúWe have to lay our feud with the New York Familia to rest and combine forces if we want to fight back the Bratva and the Triad.‚Äù Peace with the Familia? Father and every other member of the Chicago Outfit hated the Familia. They had been killing each other for decades and only recently decided on ignoring each other in favor of killing off the members of other crime organizations, like the Bratva and the Triad. ‚ÄúThere is no stronger bond than blood. At least the Familia got that right.‚Äù\n\nI frowned.\n\n‚ÄúBorn in blood. Sworn in blood. That‚Äôs their motto.‚Äù\n\nI nodded but my confusion only grew.\n\n‚ÄúI met with Salvatore Vitiello yesterday.‚Äù Father met with the Capo dei Capi, the head of the New York mob? A meeting between New York and Chicago hadn‚Äôt taken place in a decade and the last time hadn‚Äôt ended well. It was still referred to as the Bloody Thursday. And Father wasn‚Äôt even the Boss. He was only the Consigliere, the adviser to Fiore Cavallaro who ruled over the Outfit and with it the crime in the Midwest.\n\n‚ÄúWe agreed that for peace to be an option we had to become family.‚Äù Father‚Äôs eyes bored into me and suddenly I didn‚Äôt want to hear what else he had to say. ‚ÄúCavallaro and I agreed that you would marry his oldest son Luca, the future Capo dei Capi of the Familia.‚Äù\n\nI felt like I was falling. ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúVitiello and Fiore have been talking on the phone several times in the last few weeks, and Vitiello wanted the most beautiful girl for his son. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt give him the daughter of one of our soldiers. Fiore doesn‚Äôt have daughters, so he said you were the most beautiful girl available.‚Äù Gianna was just as beautiful, but she was younger. That probably saved her.\n\n‚ÄúThere are so many beautiful girls,‚Äù I choked. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Father looked at me as if I was his most prized possession.\n\n‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt many Italian girls with hair like yours. Fiore described it as golden.‚Äù Father guffawed. ‚ÄúYou are our door into the New York Familia.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut, Father, I‚Äôm fifteen. I can‚Äôt marry.‚Äù\n\nFather made a dismissive gesture. ‚ÄúIf I were to agree, you could. What do we care for laws?‚Äù\n\nI gripped the armrests so tightly, my knuckles were turning white, but I didn‚Äôt feel pain. Numbness was working its way through my body.\n\n‚ÄúBut I told Salvatore that the wedding would have to wait until you turn eighteen. Your mother was adamant you be of age and finish school. Fiore let her begging get to him.‚Äù\n\nSo the Boss had told my father the wedding had to wait. My own father would have thrown me into the arms of my future husband now. My husband. A wave of sickness crashed over me. I knew only two things about Luca Vitiello; he would become the head of the New York mob once his father retired or died, and he got his nickname ‚ÄòThe Vice‚Äô for crushing a man‚Äôs throat with his bare hands. I didn‚Äôt know how old he was. My cousin Bibiana had to marry a man thirty years her senior. Luca couldn‚Äôt be that old, if his father hadn‚Äôt retired yet. At least, that‚Äôs what I hoped. Was he cruel?\n\nHe‚Äôd crushed a man‚Äôs throat. He‚Äôll be the head of the New York mob.\n\n‚ÄúFather,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt force me to marry that man.‚Äù\n\nFather‚Äôs expression tightened. ‚ÄúYou will marry Luca Vitiello. I shook hands on it with his father Salvatore. You will be a good wife to Luca, and when you meet him for the Engagement celebrations, you‚Äôll act like an obedient lady.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEngagement party?‚Äù I echoed. My voice sounded distant, as if a veil of fog covered my ears.\n\n‚ÄúOf course. It‚Äôs a good way to establish bonds between our families, and it‚Äôll give Luca the chance to see what he‚Äôs getting out of the deal. We don‚Äôt want to disappoint him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù I cleared my throat but the lump remained. ‚ÄúWhen is the engagement party?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAugust. We haven‚Äôt set a date yet.‚Äù\n\nThat was in two months. I nodded numbly. I loved reading romance novels and whenever the couples in them married, I‚Äôd imagined how my wedding would be. I‚Äôd always imagined it would be filled with excitement and love. Empty dreams of a stupid girl.\n\n‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm allowed to keep attending school?‚Äù What did it even matter if I graduated? I would never go to college, never work. All I‚Äôd be allowed to do was to warm my husband‚Äôs bed. My throat tightened further and tears prickled in my eyes, but I willed them not to fall. Father hated it when we lost control.\n\n‚ÄúYes. I told Vitiello that you attend an all-girls Catholic school, which seemed to please him.‚Äù Of course, it did. Couldn‚Äôt risk that I got anywhere near boys.\n\n‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù\n\nI walked out of the office as if in trance. I‚Äôd turned fifteen four months ago. My birthday had felt like a huge step toward my future, and I‚Äôd been excited. Silly me. My life was already over before it even began. Everything was decided for me.\n\n***\n\nI couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Gianna stroked my hair as my head lay in her lap. She was thirteen, only eighteen months younger than me, but today those eighteen months meant the difference between freedom and a life in a loveless prison. I tried very hard not to resent her for it. It wasn‚Äôt her fault.\n\n‚ÄúYou could try to talk to Father again. Maybe he‚Äôll change his mind,‚Äù Gianna said in a soft voice.\n\n‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe Mama will be able to convince him.‚Äù\n\nAs if Father would ever let a woman make a decision for him. ‚ÄúNothing anyone could say or do will make a difference,‚Äù I said miserably. I hadn‚Äôt seen Mother since she‚Äôd sent me into Father‚Äôs office. She probably couldn‚Äôt face me, knowing what she‚Äôd condemned me to.\n\n‚ÄúBut Aria‚Äî‚Äù\n\nI lifted my head and wiped the tears from my face. Gianna stared at me with pitiful blue eyes, the same cloudless summer sky blue as my own. But where my hair was light blond hers was red. Father sometimes called her witch; it wasn‚Äôt an endearment. ‚ÄúHe shook hands on it with Luca‚Äôs father.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey met?‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôd wondered as well. Why had he found time to meet with the head of the New York Familia but not to tell me about his plans to sell me off like a better whore? I shook off the frustration and despair trying to claw their way out of my body.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Father told me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere has to be something we can do,‚Äù Gianna said.\n\n‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut you haven‚Äôt even met the guy. You don‚Äôt even know how he looks! He could be ugly, fat and old.‚Äù\n\nUgly, fat and old. I wished that were the only features of Luca I had to worry about. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs google him. There have to be photos of him on the internet.‚Äù\n\nGianna jumped up and took my laptop from my desk, then she sat down beside me, our sides pressed against each other.\n\nWe found several photos and articles about Luca. He had the coldest gray eyes I‚Äôd ever seen. I could imagine only too well how those eyes looked down at his victims before he put a bullet in their heads.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taller than everyone,‚Äù Gianna said in amazement. He was; in all the photos he was several inches taller than whoever stood beside him, and he was muscled. That probably explained why some people called him the Bull behind his back. That was the nickname the articles used and they called him the heir of businessman and club owner Salvatore Vitiello. Businessman. Maybe on the outside. Everybody knew what Salvatore Vitiello really was, but of course nobody was stupid enough to write about it.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs with a new girl in every photo.‚Äù\n\nI stared down at the emotionless face of my future husband. The newspaper called him the most sought after bachelor in New York, heir to hundreds of millions of dollars. Heir to an imperium of death and blood, that‚Äôs what it should say.\n\nGianna huffed. ‚ÄúGod, girls are throwing themselves at him. I suppose he‚Äôs good looking.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey can have him,‚Äù I said bitterly. In our world a handsome exterior often hid the monster within. The society girls saw his good looks and wealth. They thought the bad boy aura was a game. They fawned over his predator-like charisma because it radiated power. But what they didn‚Äôt know was that blood and death lurked beneath the arrogant smile.\n\nI stood abruptly. ‚ÄúI need to talk to Umberto.‚Äù\n\nUmberto was almost fifty and my father‚Äôs loyal soldier. He was also Gianna‚Äôs and my bodyguard. He knew everything about everyone. Mother called him a scandalmonger. But if anyone knew more about Luca, it was Umberto.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúHe became a Made Man at eleven,‚Äù Umberto said, sharpening his knife on a grinder as he did every day. The smell of tomato and oregano filled the kitchen, but it didn‚Äôt give me a sense of comfort as it usually did.\n\n‚ÄúAt eleven?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice even. Most people didn‚Äôt become fully initiated members of the Mafia until they were sixteen. ‚ÄúBecause of his father?‚Äù\n\nUmberto grinned, revealing a gold incisor, and paused in his movements. ‚ÄúYou think he got it easy because he‚Äôs the Boss‚Äôs son? He killed his first man at eleven, that‚Äôs why it was decided to initiate him early.‚Äù\n\nGianna gasped. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a monster.‚Äù\n\nUmberto shrugged. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs what he needs to be. Ruling over New York, you can‚Äôt be a pussy.‚Äù He gave an apologetic smile. ‚ÄúA wuss.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure I really wanted to know. If Luca had killed his first man at eleven, then how many more had he killed in the nine years since?\n\nUmberto shook his shaved head, and scratched the long scar that ran from his temple down to his chin. He was thin, and didn‚Äôt look like much, but Mother told me few were faster with a knife than him. I‚Äôd never seen him fight. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say. I‚Äôm not that familiar with New York.‚Äù\n\nI watched our cook as she prepared dinner, trying to focus on something that wasn‚Äôt my churning stomach and my overwhelming fear. Umberto scanned my face. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good catch. He‚Äôll be the most powerful man on the East coast soon enough. He‚Äôll protect you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd who will protect me from him?‚Äù I hissed.\n\nUmberto didn‚Äôt say anything because the answer was clear: nobody could protect me from Luca after our wedding. Not Umberto, and not my father if he felt so inclined. Women in our world belonged to their husband. They were his property to deal with however he pleased.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nThe last couple of months had gone by too fast no matter how much I wanted time to slow, to give me more time to prepare. Only two days until my engagement party. Mother was busy ordering the servants around, making sure the house was spotless and nothing went wrong. It wasn‚Äôt even a big celebration. Only our family, Luca‚Äôs family and the families of the respective heads of New York and Chicago were invited. Umberto said it was for safety reasons. The truce was still too fresh to risk a gathering of hundreds of guests.\n\nI wished they‚Äôd cancel it altogether. For all I cared, I didn‚Äôt have to meet Luca until the day of our wedding. Fabiano jumped up and down on my bed, a pout on his face. He was only five and had entirely too much energy. ‚ÄúI want to play!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMother doesn‚Äôt want you to race through the house. Everything needs to be perfect for the guests.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut they aren‚Äôt even here!‚Äù Thank God. Luca and the rest of the New York guests would arrive tomorrow. Only one more night until I‚Äôd be meeting my future husband, a man who killed with his bare hands. I closed my eyes.\n\n‚ÄúAre you crying again?‚Äù Fabiano hopped off the bed and walked up to me, slipping his hand into mine. His dark blonde hair was a mess. I tried to smooth it down but Fabiano jerked his head away.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I‚Äôd tried to hide my tears from him. Mostly I cried at night when I was protected by darkness.\n\n‚ÄúLily says you cry all the time because Luca has bought you.‚Äù\n\nI froze. I‚Äôd have to tell Liliana to stop saying such things. It would only get me in trouble. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt buy me.‚Äù Liar. Liar.\n\n‚ÄúSame difference,‚Äù Gianna said from the doorway, startling me.\n\n‚ÄúShhh. What if Father hears us?‚Äù\n\nGianna shrugged. ‚ÄúHe knows that I hate how he sold you like a cow.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGianna,‚Äù I warned, nodding toward Fabiano. He peered up at me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to leave,‚Äù he whispered.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving for a long time, Fabi.‚Äù He seemed satisfied with my answer and the worry disappeared from his face and was replaced by his up-to-no good expression. ‚ÄúCatch me!‚Äù he screamed and stormed off, pushing Gianna aside as he darted past her.\n\nGianna tore after him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kick your ass, you little monster!‚Äù\n\nI rushed into the corridor. Liliana poked her head out of her door and then she too ran after my brother and sister. Mother would have my head if they smashed another family heirloom. I flew down the stairs. Fabiano was still in the lead. He was fast, but Liliana had almost caught him while Gianna and I were too slow in the high heels my mother forced us to wear for practice. Fabiano dashed into the corridor leading into the west wing of the house and the rest of us followed. I wanted to shout at him to stop. Father‚Äôs office was in this part of the house. We‚Äôd be in so much trouble if he caught us playing around. Fabiano was supposed to act like a man. What five-year-old acted like a man?\n\nWe passed Father‚Äôs door and relief washed over me, but then three men rounded the corner at the end of the corridor. I parted my lips to shout a warning, but it was too late. Fabiano skidded to a halt but Liliana ran into the man in the middle with full force. Most people would have lost their balance. Most people weren‚Äôt six foot five and built like a bull.\n\nI jerked to a halt as time seemed to grind to a stop around me. Gianna gasped beside me, but my gaze was frozen on my future husband. He was looking down at the blond head of my little sister, steadying her with his strong hands. Hands he‚Äôd used to crush a man‚Äôs throat.\n\n‚ÄúLiliana,‚Äù I said, my voice shrill with fear. I never called my sister by her full name unless she was in trouble or something was seriously wrong. I wished I was better at hiding my terror. Now everyone was staring at me, including Luca. His cold gray eyes scanned me from head to toe, lingering on my hair.\n\nGod, he was tall. The men beside him were both over six feet but he dwarfed them. His hands were still on Lily‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúLiliana, come here,‚Äù I said firmly, holding out a hand. I wanted her far away from Luca. She stumbled backward, then flew into my arms, burying her face against my shoulder. Luca raised one black eyebrow.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Luca Vitiello!‚Äù Gianna said helpfully, not even bothering to hide her disgust. Fabiano made a sound like an enraged wildcat and stormed toward Luca, and started pummeling his legs and stomach with his small fists. ‚ÄúLeave Aria alone! You don‚Äôt get her!‚Äù\n\nMy heart stopped right then. The man to Luca‚Äôs side took a step forward. The outline of a gun was visible under his vest. He had to be Luca‚Äôs bodyguard, though I really couldn‚Äôt see why he needed one.\n\n‚ÄúNo, Cesare,‚Äù Luca said simply and the man stilled. Luca caught my brother‚Äôs hands in one of his, stopping the assault. I doubted he‚Äôd even felt the blows. I pushed Lily toward Gianna who wrapped a protective arm around her, then I approached Luca. I was scared out of my mind, but I needed to get Fabiano away from him. Maybe New York and Chicago were trying to lay their feud to rest, but alliances could break in a blink. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time. Luca and his men were still the enemy.\n\n‚ÄúWhat a warm welcome we get. That‚Äôs the infamous hospitality of the Outfit,‚Äù said the other man with Luca; he had the same black hair but his eyes were darker. He was a couple of inches smaller than Luca and not as broad, but it was unmistakable that they were brothers.\n\n‚ÄúMatteo,‚Äù Luca said in a low voice that made me shiver. Fabiano was still snarling and struggling like a wild animal, but Luca held him at arm-length.\n\n‚ÄúFabiano,‚Äù I said firmly, gripping his upper arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough. That‚Äôs not how we treat guests.‚Äù\n\nFabiano froze, then gazed up at me over his shoulder. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a guest. He wants to steal you away, Aria.‚Äù\n\nMatteo chuckled. ‚ÄúThis is too good. I‚Äôm glad Father convinced me to come.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOrdered you,‚Äù Luca corrected, but he didn‚Äôt take his eyes off of me. I couldn‚Äôt return his gaze. My cheeks blazed with heat at his scrutiny. My father and his bodyguards made sure that Gianna, Lily and I weren‚Äôt around men very often, and the ones he let near us were either family or ancient. Luca was neither family, nor old. He was only five years older than me, but he looked like a man and made me feel like a small girl in comparison.\n\n.........................................\nGo to Lilacnovel to search for the title \"Tied by honor\"\nRead more exciting content immediately ;)",

    "description": "Book title \"Her bossy yet naive CEO\"\nThe noisy bar was full of people. Under the colorful flashing lights, men and women gyrated on the dance floor, setting their emotions free.\n\nA figure snaked through the crowd. Wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans, her hair tied up in a simple ponytail; she looked about twenty, like a college student.\n\nHer name was Su Luoli, and she had almost been bowled over by the sheer noise when she first entered.\n\nHer naivety was completely out of place in these surroundings.\n\nIt was her first time coming to a place like this, and it took her a few minutes before she oriented herself.\n\nAt this time yesterday, she had used an ovulation test to check when she would be ovulating in the next 24 to 48 hours, and now was the time!\n\nYes, she was in this place today because she wanted a baby.\n\nShe knew that the \"old man\" at home was never going to get her pregnant. Moreover, he had left her at the villa for a whole year. So she would have to find someone else to get pregnant with.\n\nEven though having this baby was her last resort, no one wanted their child to lose out in the looks department, so she needed to find the right target.\n\nSu Luoli bit her bottom lip and scanned the men around her with her almond eyes. The one sitting at the bar caught her eye.\n\nHe was facing away from her and she could only see his profile, but that profile charmed her entirely!\n\nThose delicate features, especially that high nose bridge, those thin lips, and the eyelashes so long they left a shadow under his eyes.\n\nHe looked mixed.\n\nThe sapphire earring in his left ear sparkled under the brilliant lights, mesmerizing her.\n\nSu Luoli took a deep breath. Her heart felt like it was going to jump out of her mouth. She had never done this before and she could not help but be nervous.\n\nShe mimicked the way the seniors in school picked up girls and tapped the man's shoulder. \"Hi!\"\n\nThe man turned to her. It did not matter which way he turned; his profile was enough to capture her heart, but from the front he was almost too handsome to bear!\n\nHis light blue eyes were so charming!\n\nSu Luoli was so lost in her admiration of this handsome man that she stood stunned for a while!\n\n\"Why are you so late?!\" The man seemed a bit angry. He stood up, grabbing Su Luoli's wrist, and walked out. Su Luoli had no idea what was happening!\n\nShe only knew that he was strong. Her wrist felt like it would shatter in his grip!\n\nThe man walk straight to the hotel next door, where everything seemed to be already prepared. He headed straight to the presidential suite on the third floor, and opened the door with a keycard. The whole process was smooth.\n\nOnce inside, the man stripped off his white T-shirt, revealing his tanned chest.\n\nSu Luoli sucked in a breath. This man's figure was too good to be true!\n\nA well-defined broad chest with every muscle perfect, and not a trace of fat on his body, especially those alluring abs.\n\nNot only was his face bewitching, his body too!\n\nShe almost had a nosebleed!\n\nAfter taking off his T-shirt, the man proceeded to remove his belt.\n\nSu Luoli's eyes widened, almost able to see what lay below his waist. She immediately stepped forward to grab the hand that was removing the belt. \"Wait!\"\n\nThe man frowned slightly, narrowing his blue eyes and asked, \"What?\"\n\n\"Isn't this a bit too fast?\" Su Luoli laughed, her cheeks red.\n\n\"Fast? Is it?\" The man have Su Luoli a once-over, taking in the flush across her small and beautiful face. She became shy as he looked at her, and she averted her gaze.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. I should flirt first.\" The man let go of his belt and walked into the bedroom, calling out, \"Say anything you wish.\"\n\nHe switched on the light in the bedroom and Su Luoli entered timidly.\n\nThen, as silence fell between them, the man began to really look at Su Luoli.\n\nA standard oval face that was a bit thin, with a pointed chin and some natural baby fat on her cheeks. She looked cute and pretty, and gave off a comfortable aura.\n\nUnder her arched eyebrows, her crystal clear eyes were like obsidian, giving off an alluring glow. Her eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings, and they drew him in.\n\nBut maybe‚Ä¶ her breasts were a bit small?\n\nIt might have been his first time, but he had often listened to Ye Bin speak about women. Even without any experience with women, he had eyes too. He knew about the type of women who sought out men for sex!\n\n\"That trash Ye Bin. He said he'd find a good one, but he's taken them for himself!\" the man muttered.\n\n\"Huh? What did you say?\" Su Luoli did not catch what he had just said.\n\n\"Nothing. Don't you want to flirt? Don't just stand there like an idiot. Say something!\"\n\nThe man had a powerful voice with a commanding attitude.\n\nHis name was Wen Qingmu.\n\nIn Z City, this was a familiar name to many.\n\nThe founder and current CEO of the Dark Empire, and an all-powerful and omnipotent person.\n\nRumor had it that Wen Qingmu was a genius gamer. He had started out in the gaming industry, and the games he created had monopolized the whole market. After that, Dark Empire expanded rapidly, developing beyond the game industry into many other industries. This also led to a rapid growth in Wen Qingmu's wealth.\n\nAt just twenty-six, he was one of a handful of the richest people, not just domestically, but internationally.\n\nHowever, he never made any public appearances and no one had ever seen him.\n\nSu Luoli gulped. \"I‚Ä¶ I have one request.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Wen Qingmu was beginning to look impatient.\n\n\"No condom.\"\n\nAt this, Wen Qingmu‚Äôs jaw almost fell to the floor!\n\nYe Bin had been very clear on this, always wear a condom!\n\nFor one, due to his special status, it would be a problem if there was an accidental pregnancy. For another, who knew where these women had been; he did not want to catch anything.\n\n\"Why!\" Wen Qingmu fixed his sinister gaze on Su Luoli, unnerving her.\n\n\"Because‚Ä¶\" Su Luoli did not want to bring up the fact that she wanted a baby. She had been hoping to get pregnant quietly and without any trouble.\n\n\"If you don't explain, I'm not going to touch you!\" Wen Qingmu said coldly.\n\nSu Luoli did not want to miss out on this chance and lose out on the man in front of her. Where else could she find such good genes!\n\nIn for a dime, in for a dollar!\n\n\"Because I want a baby!\"\n\nWen Qingmu was shocked yet again!\n\nThis woman looked barely out of her twenties, and she wanted a baby?\n\nWas‚Ä¶ was she alright in the head?\n\n\"Why‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"Don't worry! I'll never come after you! I'll take care of the baby myself! We won't have anything to do with your money!\"\n\nSu Luoli swore immediately.\n\nWen Qingmu once again suspected that this woman was not alright in the head.\n\nSu Luoli could see that Wen Qingmu was still doubtful, and she gathered her courage to sit next to him. \"I'm a trustworthy person. I have special reasons for wanting this baby. After today, we won't have anything to do with each other. Even if we see each other in the street, we can act as if we've never met before!\"\n\n\"Why do you want a baby?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you that,\" Su Luoli said, shaking her head.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, then she cast her eyes down. \"Um‚Ä¶that‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶this is my first time, so‚Ä¶if you could take the lead‚Ä¶\"\n\nShe was a virgin!\n\nThis excited Wen Qingmu!\n\nBut it was his first time too; he did not have any experience! Ye Bin said that tonight was when he would lose that status!\n\nHe had not expected that trash Ye Bin to find him a virgin. Was he deliberately giving him trouble?\n\nHe would settle things with Ye Bin tomorrow.\n\nSu Luoli peeked at Wen Qingmu. \"Okay‚Ä¶ You can start.\"\n\nSaying it was one thing, but the two of them sat there unmoving, and the atmosphere was quite awkward.\n\nWen Qingmu cleared his throat. \"I'll take the lead, but can you take the initiative to kiss me?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Women's flirting is more interesting, otherwise it would be boring.\"\n\n\"Well‚Ä¶okay.\"\n\nSu Luoli nodded and slowly moved to Wen Qingmu's side. She looked up at him.\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\nHis blue eyes were dreamy, fulfilling the expectations that all girls have of their Prince Charming.\n\nHe felt his throat tighten at her blushing face.\n\nSu Luoli inched slowly toward Wen Qingmu.\n\nFive centimeters, four centimeters, three centimeters, two centimeters‚Ä¶\n\nShe shut her eyes and went for it, kissing Wen Qingmu on the lips.\n\nWen Qingmu, who had never been kissed before, was surprised!\n\nHer lips were soft and their damp warmth stunned him. He immediately reacted and kissed her back.\n\nThe unexpected kiss surprised Su Luoli. Her eye widened and chest suddenly felt tight and numb.\n\nWen Qingmu shoved his hand under Su Luoli's shirt and groped at her impatiently, then with a ripping sound, tore her clothes off.\n\nWen Qingmu pushed her down under him.\n\nEven though she had prepared herself mentally, when the time came, Su Luoli was still as panicked as a deer in headlights.\n\n\"Again!\" Wen Qingmu wanted more, but as he pulled Su Luoli over to him, he saw that she had passed out.\n\nThis disappointed Wen Qingmu somewhat. He was still interested in more, but she was asleep!\n\nWen Qingmu sat up with a 'tsk'. Standing up, he looked over at the sleeping Su Luoli and observed her beautiful body.\n\nHer breasts were small, but besides that, there was nothing wrong with this woman's body.\n\nMore importantly, it suited him.\n\nJust then, Wen Qingmu's phone rang. Picking it up, he saw that, coincidentally, it was Ye Bin.\n\n\"F you, you wretch, I have something to settle with you!\"\n\nWen Qingmu had just spoken, when an impatient voice said back to him, \"Bro! Weren't you the one nagging me about giving up your virginity after twenty-six years? I found someone, but where are you?!\"\n\n\"I'm in the hotel!\"\n\n\"Why are you in the hotel? Weren't you supposed to wait in the bar? Our girl has been waiting a full two hours for you! Get there now!\"\n\n\"What girl? Isn't she on my‚Ä¶\" Bed?\n\nWen Qingmu glanced at the naked Su Luoli on the bed.\n\nDamn!\n\nHe must have got the wrong person!\n\nIf the girl Ye Bin had found him was still in the bar, then who was this on the bed?!\n\n\"Hurry and go to the bar! I guarantee that the girl I've got you is way better than your wife at home by a thousand times!\" Ye Bin continued.\n\nSu Luoli woke up the next morning at around nine. As she got up, her body felt like it had been ripped apart, and as if she had been crushed. Everywhere hurt.\n\nThat man was too rough last night!\n\nShe could barely stand it.\n\nShe pushed herself up into a sitting position, and her legs trembled slightly as she got off the bed.\n\nIt was only after a shower that she discovered the bruises all over her body; some were made by fingers and some were hickeys.\n\n\"Pervert!\" Su Luoli muttered, as she discovered her clothes had been torn apart by that man. She had no choice but to seek help from the hotel staff.\n\nLuckily, this was the presidential suite and the service was impeccable.\n\nDressed in clothes borrowed from the staff, she quickly left.\n\nDark Empire CEO office.\n\nThe well-decorated office was clean and tidy. Nothing was out of place and no defects could be found.\n\nThere were three computers on the curved desk.\n\nWen Qingmu sat at the desk, but all the monitors were dark. He had no mood to work since this morning; all his thoughts were on the woman he had mistakenly slept with last night.\n\nHis secretary Yin Jin walked in. \"Mr. Wen, you were looking for me.\"\n\nYin Jin was the head of Wen Qingmu's secretaries. At twenty-eight, he had joined Dark Empire straight out of university, and was considered one of Wen Qingmu's senior employees.\n\n\"Investigate someone for me.\" Wen Qingmu pulled up a photo on his phone.\n\nThe photo was of Su Luoli. Last night, Wen Qingmu had taken a photo of Su Luoli's naked body, but the version he showed Yin Jin was cropped. He was not going to show a naked photo of the woman he slept with to anyone!\n\nYin Jin stepped forward to take Wen Qingmu's phone. His eyes immediately widened!\n\n\"Ma...ma...ma‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"Ma‚Äîwhat? Find out everything about this woman!\" Wen Qingmu ordered with a frown.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, isn't this Madam?\" Yin Jin managed to calm himself.\n\nYin Jin had singlehandedly arranged Wen Qingmu's marriage, so naturally, he had seen Su Luoli before.\n\n\"Madam?\" Wen Qingmu was confused.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, have you forgotten? A year ago, you and Madam registered your marriage, and you arranged to have her stay in the Rainbow City villa.\n\nWen Qingmu slammed both hands on the table with a bang and stood up. He fixed his sinister gaze on Yin Jin. \"You're saying that the woman in this photo is my wife?!\"\n\nWen Qingmu had never seen Su Luoli before. He had not even wanted this marriage business, so he had not even attended the marriage registration.\n\nWhile people usually needed to be physically present for a marriage registration, the government employees had not dared to do anything because of who he was!\n\nTherefore, until now, he did not know what his wife looked like, and had even forgotten that he was even married!\n\nYin Jin had no idea why Wen Qingmu was suddenly incensed. Back straight, he took two steps back and nodded. \"Yes‚Ä¶sir.\"\n\nWen Qingmu took two harsh breaths and sat down again!\n\nThis meant that his wife had been cheating on him last night!\n\nThat woman!\n\nEven though in a strange twist of fate, it had ended up being him she had slept with, what if she had met someone else? He would have been cheated on?!\n\n\"Mr.‚ÄîMr. Wen, you mentioned everything about Madam. A year ago, when you got married, I already completed the investigation. Shall I get it for you?\"\n\n\"Well hurry up about it!\" Wen Qingmu shouted at Yin Jin.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Yin Jin hurried out of the office. Five minutes later, he was back with Su Luoli's information.\n\nThank goodness for his habit of keeping information. Otherwise, their mighty CEO might explode today!\n\nIt was just one sheet of A4 paper and Wen Qingmu's eyes narrowed. \"Is this a joke? That's all?!\"\n\nYin Jin bowed deeply, barely daring to take a deep breath. \"Yes sir, at the time, you also felt that Madam's background was very clean. That's why you agreed to marry her.\"\n\nWen Qingmu had completely forgotten all of this and scanned through the paper.\n\nSu Luoli, twenty-one, third-year performance major at Z University's Academy of Film.\n\nFather: Su Kun. Mother: Wang Bangxiang.\n\nYounger brother: Su Jianmo.\n\nYounger half-sister: Su Ruoyun.\n\nYounger half-brother: Su Ruoyao.\n\nTheir Su Winery had been passed down the generations, but it was not doing well and facing closure.\n\nThe rest was an introduction of Su Luoli, but it was all irrelevant and only half of the paper was used.\n\n\"Su Luoli‚Ä¶\" Wen Qingmu read the name out. So her name was Su Luoli.\n\nThis was last year's information, so she would be twenty-two this ahead and graduating soon.\n\nEven though this woman had given him enjoyment last night, allowing him to taste the beauty of a first time, when he thought about her running around cheating on him, it maddened him!\n\n\"Where is she now?\" Wen Qingmu raised his head.\n\n\"Mr. Wen, as you instructed, she was settled in the Rainbow City villa. She doesn't live there often, and sometimes stays on campus or visits her brother. Now‚Ä¶ Now it's May, so she should be graduating.\"\n\nYin Jin's nervous answer was very detailed.\n\n\"A villa for her and she runs around all the time!\" Wen Qingmu crushed the A4 sheet into a ball and threw it into the trash can!\n\nIt seemed like she had been planning to cheat on him!\n\nHowever, she had not managed to, because he knew last night was her first time.\n\nYe Bin said that women would bleed if it was their first time, and he saw traces of blood on the white sheets yesterday.\n\n\"Is there anyone else in Rainbow City?\"\n\n\"There's a maid there to take care of Madam. A girl of about twenty.\"\n\n\"Tell her that I'm coming home tonight.\"\n\nYin Jin froze. He had not gone back for one year and now he suddenly wanted to?\n\nNevertheless, he did not ask more. Once Wen Qingmu was angry, it was better to do as he said.\n\nZ University's Academy of Film.\n\nIt was May and Su Luoli was about to graduate. Balancing a graduation thesis and work, she was extremely busy.\n\nShe had been tossed around roughly by that man last night, and had gone home to rest for a while, but she still dragged her tired body to campus. She needed more data and was going to head straight to the library.\n\nA red Maserati stopped right in front of her, its brakes attracting the attention of many people around.\n\nThe car door opened and revealed a pair of red heels, followed closely by a beautiful pair of legs, and finally, Su Luoli saw her.\n\nHer younger sister, Su Ruoyun.\n\n\"Woah, look it's Su Ruoyun. That's a sweet sports car!\"\n\n\"Of course! Her boyfriend is the CEO of Yixin International. She's already signed to them. It's only a matter of time before she becomes famous!\"\n\nThe envious voices of the people around were in full discussion.\n\nSu Luoli did not want to cross her path, so she pretended not to notice and was about to head towards the library when that familiar voice called out.\n\n\"Hey Sis! Long time no see!\" Su Ruoyun took off her sunglasses and casually waved at Su Luoli.\n\nSu Luoli shut her eyes and took a deep breath before turning around, a blinding smile that did not reach her eyes plastered on her face. \"Yes, long time no see, what a coincidence.\"\n\nMany graduates from the academy had gone on to become future celebrities, and Su Ruoyun had already become a star since her second year.\n\nShe used to practice aerobics and had even represented the school in international competitions. After that, she had chosen to major in performance, and had signed with Yixin International. To many people, she was already a rising star!\n\nHer appearance naturally drew a lot of attention and everyone came over.\n\n\"Su Ruoyun has a sister?\" someone asked carefully.\n\n\"Oh yes, I heard that Su Ruoyun can do anything, and her sister can't do anything! They're both performance majors, but Su Ruoyun always plays the lead and her sister has small roles!\"\n\nListening to the comments of the people nearby, Su Luoli felt a bitter taste in her heart.\n\n\"It's so good to see you today. Yi and I will be getting engaged soon, you must come then.\"\n\n\"Oh really? It's been a while hasn't it?\" Su Luoli could not help but scoff in disdain.\n\nThis provoked Su Ruoyun and her expression turned ugly, but she quickly became snooty again.\n\n\"Oh yes, the Murongs are such a big family that these things take a while. But don't worry, you'll be attending our wedding banquet very soon.\"\n\nSu Ruoyun was full of arrogance. She felt she had the right to lord her superiority over Su Luoli.\n\nAfter all, Murong Yi used to be Su Luoli's.\n\nSu Luoli did not show the slightest bit of sadness. \"Sure, I'll drink more then. I can't waste all the effort that my baby sister put into my future brother-in-law!\"\n\nOf course, Su Ruoyun knew that Su Luoli's words had a hidden meaning. Su Luoli had always been good with words, and now that she had been defeated by her, that was all Su Luoli was reduced to.\n\n\"Sis, I heard that no company wants to sign you and you're still playing small roles. Perhaps I can ask Yi to help you?\"\n\n\"There's no need, I can find a company to sign to myself. If there's nothing else, I'm going to the library.\"\n\nSu Luoli shot her a disdainful glance and started to turn away.\n\n\"I know you're unhappy! You should have taken better care of him!\" Su Ruoyun did not want her to have the last word.\n\nJust as Su Luoli turned away, a sapphire blue sports car zoomed over and came to a screeching halt in front of them.\n\nIt was a Ferrari LaFerrari!\n\nUnder the light of the sun, this sapphire blue Ferrari LaFerrari was like a predator in waiting, full of murderous intent!\n\nEveryone's gaze was attracted to the Ferrari LaFerrari that had just showed up.\n\nWhile the academy was no stranger to celebrity graduates and the fancy cars that celebrity classmates drove, no one had ever seen this car!\n\nEven Su Ruoyun stared at the car with envious eyes. It cost ten times more than her Maserati!\n\nAnd she had pestered Murong Yi so much for so long before he agreed to buy it for her.\n\nThe car door opened and a man stepped out.\n\nWen Qingmu.\n\nHe was dressed in light gray linen pants and a white T-shirt, and looked natural and comfortable.\n\nThat bewitching face and those blue eyes were displayed for everyone to see, as if ready to suck in the souls of everyone present!\n\nThe moment Su Luoli caught sight of Wen Qingmu, her eyes widened and she wished there was a crack in the pavement that she could sink into!\n\nWas the world really that small?\n\nShe had only slept with him last night and today she had bumped into him!\n\nWen Qingmu calmly walked up to Su Luoli, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and pulling her domineeringly into his arms.\n\nSu Luoli was stunned and did not react.\n\nSu Ruoyun was confused, had Su Luoli found a boyfriend?\n\n\"Sis, this is‚Ä¶\" Su Ruoyun looked Wen Qingmu up and down.\n\n\"Uh‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"Can't you tell?\" Wen Qingmu raised an eyebrow, his face full of arrogance.\n\nSu Ruoyun smiled prettily and reached out her hand, saying, \"You must be my sister's boyfriend. Hi, I'm Su Ruoyun. I'm Su Luoli's younger sister.\"\n\nWen Qingmu frowned slightly at her outstretched hand and did not take it.\n\n\"Oh, and?\" he asked dismissively.\n\nThis embarrassed Su Ruoyun to no end.\n\nShe turned her gaze to Su Luoli. \"Sis, why didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend? I can finally relax now that you've moved on from Yi. I was so worried when you refused to eat or drink.\"\n\nSu Luoli was very sure that Su Ruoyun did not want to see her do well. Even if she did have a boyfriend, Su Ruoyun would try and make trouble for her.\n\nWen Qingmu was no fool though, and could tell there was more to those words.\n\n\"I still need to go to the library. Bye.\" Su Luoli could not wait to leave.\n\n\"Okay then, I won't bother you. When Yi and I get engaged, you need to bring your boyfriend.\" Su Ruoyun waved and drove off in her Maserati.\n\nSu Luoli glanced sideways at Wen Qingmu, then shoved his hand away and rushed to the library!\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe crowd dispersed.\n\nSu Luoli swiped her card to enter the library and took a deep breath. Only students were allowed to enter the library, and even students were barred entry if they forgot their library card.\n\nShe really did not want to see that man!\n\nSu Luoli walked among the shelves until she found the book she was looking for according to the index. However, the book was on the highest shelf, and she was just not tall enough to reach it.\n\nAfter jumping a few times but still unable to reach it, she was staring up at the book helplessly when a slim hand reached up to grab it.\n\nSu Luoli raised her head to see Wen Qingmu's sneaky grin.\n\n\"How did you get in?\"\n\n\"That was easy. A couple of words to the lady at the door and she let me in,\" Wen Qingmu replied haughtily, raising an eyebrow.\n\nSu Luoli grit her teeth angrily!\n\nThe lady at the door!\n\nThese four years, every time she forgot to bring her library card, the lady would always refuse to let her in no matter how much she persuaded her. Now she let an outsider in so easily!\n\nShe must have been seduced!\n\n\"Didn't we agree that we didn't know each other? What do you want?\" Su Luoli whispered harshly.\n\nThe library was quiet and anything louder would be overheard by other students.\n\n\"You were right last night. We moved too fast. We should've made things clear first.\"\n\n\"What do you mean fast? Wasn't everything clear?\" Su Luoli glared angrily at Wen Qingmu.\n\nWen Qingmu moved closer to Su Luoli and whispered low in her ear, \"You mean I was slow last night? Do you want me to be faster next time?\"\n\nSu Luoli caught his meaning and her face flushed red. She bit her lip.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Nothing much? You just need to explain things to me. Why do you want a baby?\"\n\nSu Luoli swept a glance at Wen Qingmu. \"This has absolutely nothing to do with you. Even if I'm really pregnant, I won't bother you at all. You can rest assured!\"\n\nAs she spoke, Su Luoli scanned around them, afraid that any classmates or teachers would come by.\n\nWith a hand on the bookshelf behind her, Wen Qingmu blocked Su Luoli with his body, pushing her against the bookshelf.\n\nHe looked down directly at Su Luoli's blushing face.\n\nOn the other hand, Su Luoli looked up straight into Wen Qingmu's shining eyes.\n\nThose amazing features on that exquisite face, and those sensual lips‚Ä¶\n\nHer blush became a deeper shade of red.\n\nThis man was just bewitching!\n\nSu Luoli used both hands to push at Wen Qingmu's chest, but he did not budge.\n\nJust as she was removing her hands, Wen Qingmu grabbed one of her hands with one of his and pressed it to his chest.\n\n\"If you want to touch, just ask. You can keep touching. I won't charge you!\"\n\nSu Luoli's face somehow turned even redder, like a ripe tomato, and her breath quickened!\n\n\"Who wants to touch you!\" She turned her head to the side.\n\n\"Then what are you blushing about?\" Wen Qingmu let go of Su Luoli's hand and lifted up her chin, turning her red face towards him.\n\nSu Luoli wanted to struggle, but while she was strong for a girl, her opponent was a very strong man!\n\nHer little strength was nothing compared to Wen Qingmu!\n\n\"Ow it hurts!\" Su Luoli felt like her chin was being crushed.\n\nWen Qingmu loosened his grip at that. \"Well, are you going to tell me?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell. It doesn't matter to you, and it has nothing to do with you. Please just let me go‚Ä¶ Let's just act like‚Ä¶we had a bad date, and pretend we don't know who each other is!\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\nWen Qingmu scoffed and retrieved his phone from his pocket. He picked a photo from the album and showed it to Su Luoli.\n\n\"I've got something to show you.\"\n\nSu Luoli was shocked too see the photo on the screen!\n\nShe was naked!\n\nThere were hickeys all over her body!\n\nShe snatched at Wen Qingmu's phone but he kept it immediately. \"Will you tell me now?\"\n\n\"You're evil!\" Su Luoli leveled a ruthless glare at Wen Qingmu. \"How dare you take my photo!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm evil. If you don't tell me, do you believe that I'll send this photo to everyone in the school?\"\n\n\"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"There's something even more shocking, do you want to see it?\"\n\n.........................................\nRead the Full Version üëâ\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Her bossy yet naive CEO\"\nRead more exciting content immediately ;)",
